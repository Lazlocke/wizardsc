Her tails transform into tentacles and she
attacks.
#
A few weeks later...
#
<music 37>
<background "ev119a0.iph" 10>
She leaps into the man's arms.
#
Tears are pouring from her eyes.
#
<name "Silver Fox" "!HC0072">
"I missed you."
#
She hugs him tight.
#
It's a young man from a small village.
#
They met when he was young and they lived 
together.
#
But he fell sick.
#
To save his life, she took him inside her, and to
keep him alive, she attacked other demons.
#
But she knew that it would make him sad if she 
were to take a life to prolong his, so she stole
their strength without killing them.
#
It would have been quick if she had taken the
strength from a man, but she had no intention of
giving her body to any man but the one before her.
#
So it took time.
#
It's been a hundred years since the man fell ill.
#
But here he is now, standing before her once
again.
#
<name "Silver Fox" "!HC0073">
"I missed you so much..."
#
There will be many trials ahead.
#
But she will face them with him.
#
With him by her side.
#
That alone will make her strong enough to face
anything.

There are a lot of different kinds of demons,
huh?
#
Better write it all down.

By the way, Miss Horn woke up three years later.
#
<name "Miss Horn" "!MC0048">
"I hoped it'd work out for you..."
#
Her friend was waiting nearby for her to awaken.
#
<name "Silver Fox" "!HC0074">
"Heheheh...
 We have a child."
#
She brags.
#
<name "Miss Horn" "!MC0049">
".........I need to find a man too."
