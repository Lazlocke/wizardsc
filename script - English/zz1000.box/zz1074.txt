Celestine Rococo was invited to become a court
wizard for Queensbell.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6576">
"Huh?
 Me? A court wizard?"
#
She was surprised, but in the end, she decided to
accept the position.
#
It was offered to her based on what she's
accomplished, but she had a recommendation from
the Guild, not to mention Viola backed her as
well.
#
To be honest, I'm not sure she's ready for it
just yet.
#
But I know she'll figure it out.
#
I sent her off, trusting in her.

Celestine Rococo.
#
She wanted to be a wizard, realized her goals,
and as a court wizard, will research all kinds of
new and revolutionary things.
#
I'm satisfied with how my apprentice turned out,
but wondering now if I should take another one.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6577">
"Me alone is enough apprentices for you."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Thank you for that, but don't you have work to
 do?
 They'll get mad if you keep coming to my house."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6578">
"Viola's here too, so it's fine."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1018">
"Still no tea?"
#
...
#
Sigh...
#
Looking at the two of them, I sincerely wonder
if the court wizards of Queensbell are going to
be okay.
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1019">
"Tea."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, yeah."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6579">
"Ah, Master.
 For me too."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I know."
#
But, well, I have a feeling that between the two
of them, they can take care of whatever needs to
be done.
#
In fact, I'm sure of it.
#
...As long as they feel like it.
