<name "Manager" "!HA0094">
"Congratulations.
 You did well to make it this far."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA3880">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Manager" "!HA0096">
"This is the top of the Tower of Heroes."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA3881">
"I-It is?"
#
<name "Manager" "!HA0097">
"There's no limit to the hero's journey, but there
 is a limit to this tower."
#
<name "Manager" "!HA0098">
"This tower probably is too small for you.
 You should travel into the wider world."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA3882">
"I see..."
#
<name "Manager" "!HA0099">
"The world is vast."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA3883">
"Yeah. I understand.
 Thank you for everything."
#
<name "Manager" "!HA0100">
"No, I should be the one thanking you."
#
<name "Manager" "!HA0101">
"Celestine Rococo, you are a hero wizard who will
 change the world."
#
<name "Manager" "!HA0102">
"I'm looking forward to it."
