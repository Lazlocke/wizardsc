"Let's make a game where we're the protagonists!"
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0491">
"A fantasy setting?
 Modern day?
 Or the future?"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0456">
"Modern day!"
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0493">
"Ooh! A challenge!"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0457">
"First, we have to explain the benefits of making
 a game like that to the developers."
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0426">
"I want to hear that.
 What are the benefits?"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0458">
"First, because we don't have faces, it's very
 easy to change our expressions!"
#
<name "Hopkins" "!UA0485">
"Oh, bro. I think it's cause we're totally 
 mosaics. That has nothing to do with our 
 expressions."
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0460">
"W-What!?"
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0427">
"On the other hand, won't that make it harder 
 because then you need to use body language?"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0461">
"Then the next benefit!"
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0494">
"Bring it on!"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0462">
"The sex is all tentacles!"
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0428">
"...Uh."
#
<name "Hopkins" "!UA0486">
"Hmm..."
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0495">
"Don't mind it, bro!"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0463">
"Um, that won't work?
 I think it sounds fine."
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0496">
"Bro, don't be dreaming while you're wide awake."
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0429">
"Right."
#
<name "Hopkins" "!UA0487">
"Yeah, yeah."
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0464">
"Fools!
 Are you saying that you cannot comprehend my
 sublime genius!?"
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0430">
"Sublime...
 Is a tentacle only eroge really sublime?"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0465">
"It's sublime!"
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0497">
"S-So confident...
 Well said, bro!
 That's our leader!"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0466">
"Okay!
 So let's hear what the public has to say!"
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0431">
"H-How do we do that?"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0467">
"Everybody who wants a game with us as the main
 characters should send in a tentacle postcard.
 If there are a bunch, we could convince one of
 the VIPs!"
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0498">
"Wouldn't the writers revolt?"
#
<name "Boss" "!HA0324">
"Subversive elements will be eliminated."
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0432">
"Huh?
 Who was that?"
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0499">
"Huh?
 Bro?"
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0433">
"Where are you going?"
#
<name "Hopkins" "!UA0488">
"H-He's getting dragged away!"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0468">
"Please send in the postcards!!!!"
