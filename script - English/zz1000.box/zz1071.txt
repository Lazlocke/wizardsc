Celes joined Guild Preservation and took a 
position where she trained a huge number of
subordinates.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6537">
"You, swing with more force."
#
She watched over their training, and occasionally
stepped in to train them herself.
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1211">
"They're quite honed."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6538">
"Yes. I have to surpass your own unit."
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1212">
"In tomorrow's sparring match?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6539">
"Yes. This time, we'll win."
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1213">
"I look forward to it.
 The individual matches afterwards too."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6540">
"Hahaha...
 Go easy on me."
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1214">
"After winning repeatedly, I don't think you have
 any right to say that."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6541">
"Hahaha...
 By the way, about these maid dresses..."
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1215">
"It looks good on you.
 Does it not fit?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6542">
"No, it fits perfectly, but do I have to wear it?"
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1216">
"If you don't like it, I can rip it right off you
 right here."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6543">
"...N-No, I like it."
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1218">
"That was a joke.
 Outside His Grace, you are half my apprentice
 as well, so I believe that you should dress like
 a maid."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6544">
"Really?"
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1219">
"Yes, but if you really don't like it, feel free
 to not wear them."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6545">
"No, I want to keep wearing them.
 I am your apprentice too."
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1220">
"..."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6546">
"What is it?"
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1221">
"Nothing. Thank you.
 In return, I'll go full strength in our sparring
 match."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6547">
"Hahaha..."

Celestine Rococo.
#
Known as the Cleaner of the Guild.
A wizard who puts fear into other wizards.
#
She researched and mastered countless battle
techniques.
#
She honed her body with training and magic.
#
An unstoppable warrior who far surpasses the
top warriors and martial artists across the land,
said to even be able to slay dragons.
#
And her strength has become even more fearsome
once she learned how to fight in coordination
with others.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6548">
"There's this one person who doesn't listen to
 me, but I keep trying to do new things..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Don't get mad about it."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6549">
"No, I am mad.
 I'm not finished yet."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, yeah."
#
I'm making tea while listening to her vent.
#
Well, it's supposed to be more like a report on
her recent activities than venting.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6550">
"Master, are you listening to me?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, I'm listening."
#
I wonder who's stronger...
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6551">
"What?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"No, nothing."
#
Anyway, I'm proud of my apprentice.
