Celes started working as a teacher at Rune 
Academy.
#
Given her capabilities, she could've had a much
better job, but she refused all offers.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6523">
"...And it turns out like that.
 Understand?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6524">
"Now, before we go to the next thing...
 Does anybody have any questions about what I've
 covered?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6525">
"Yes, what is it?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6526">
"Um... I can't answer that question."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6527">
"Next time you ask me that, I'm going to get mad."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6528">
"So, next?"

Celestine Rococo.
#
While not famous, she was an excellent wizard,
and made her name as a fine teacher.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Seems like you're hard at work."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6529">
"I've still got a long way to go.
 I want to be like you someday."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Living carefree at home?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6530">
"That would be nice too.
 By the way..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hm?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6531">
"I heard you took a new apprentice..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, the Guild's been champing at the bit for
 me to do that. They want a second, or even third
 Celes."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6532">
"Grr..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Don't be mad.
 You're my finest apprentice."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6533">
"But..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Besides, even if I take an apprentice, I won't
 be with them like you."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6534">
"Really?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, so is there a problem?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6535">
"Can I come by sometimes to help?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I don't mind.
 Train them hard."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6536">
"Yes, sir."
