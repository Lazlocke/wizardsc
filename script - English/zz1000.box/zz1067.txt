Celestine Rococo became my wife, and we had a son
and a daughter.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6497">
"Hey! Don't just fight all the time!"
#
The squabbling children began to make excuses
when she yelled at them.
#
Who started it?
#
Both say that the other did.
#
They're saying different things, but both are
accusing the other of going after them.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6498">
"Be quiet!"
#
She scolds them.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6499">
"No fighting.
 I know I taught you that."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6500">
"If you want to fight...
 That's a challenge for Mom."
#
Both of them bow their heads and profusely
apologize.
#
They don't want a fight with her.
#
Nor do I.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6501">
"And you, don't just watch.
 If they're fighting, stop them."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Okay, but... the reason the argument started was
 over who got to sit on my lap first."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6502">
"Honestly..."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6503">
"That privilege belongs to me."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Your kids aren't your competition."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6504">
"Then please love me a little more."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"All right.
 Then should we try for a third?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6505">
"Yep.ÅÙ"
#
Celes and I try to be romantic, but the children
quickly interrupt. 
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6506">
"Grrrr!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Don't compete with the kids."

Celes hasn't given up on becoming a wizard, but
has taken a detour with raising my children.
#
And maybe that's what was best for her.
#
It's a side job to being a mother, but she's still
researching and learning magic every day.
She's leading a calm, peaceful life as a wizard.
#
Unfortunately, neither of our children have the
talent for magic, but Celes doesn't care and is
helping them look for what they want to do with
their lives.
#
I'm helping too.
#
As a dad, at least.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6507">
"Lately, I've been having trouble trying to
 explain our relationship to the kids."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hm? What's the problem?
 You should just tell them you became my devoted
 apprentice."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6508">
"And you're the master who took advantage of his
 apprentice?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hmm..."
#
Well, there are problems here and there, but it's
not a bad life.
