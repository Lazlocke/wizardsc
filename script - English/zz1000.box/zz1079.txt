"Anyway, this one is better than that."

<name "Lazlocke">
"Oh?"

<name "Elle" "!CA0906">
"Yes. Trust in the eyes of a merchant's daughter."

<name "Lazlocke">
"All right."

Elle is continuing to study magic under Viola.
#
According to Viola, she's not ready yet.

<name "Elle" "!CA0907">
"What are you going to make today?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"There's a fruit dish that I want to try."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0908">
"I'll help."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"That'd be nice, but..."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0909">

Elle Bluetact.
#
She's still in training.
#
When Viola's busy, I look after her, and it looks
like that's how it'll be for quite a while.
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0910">
"Next time, I'd like to compete."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Oh? In magic, or cooking?"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0911">
"Both.
 I want to get better at both."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I see. That should be fun."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0912">
"Yes, and... I want to hone my skills in bed too."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"........."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0913">
"Are you looking forward to that?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"..."
#
I bonk her on the head.
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0914">
"Ohh..."
#
I'm getting along well with her.
