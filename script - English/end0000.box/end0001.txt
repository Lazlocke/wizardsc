Two months later...
#
Celes wasn't able to win Coudures, and couldn't
get her family's home back.
#
Because of that, she fell into depression, but
still believed that she should do whatever she
could.
#
So, what's she going to do next?

Two months later...
#
Celes wasn't able to win Coudures, but she
regained her family's home.
#
I had an inkling that the Guild pulled some
strings, but apparently the usurper heard about
how much she had grown, was scared, and 
relinquished it on his own.
#
I'm not sure what the truth really is, but in any
case, Celes is the new head of the Rococo family.
#
She was confused about it too, but soon enough,
was so happy that she was in tears.
#
She fulfilled her goal.
#
So, what's she going to do next?

Returning her home through pressure from the Guild
wasn't going to happen, but they might have
suggested Celes would try to take it back by
force.
#
To be honest, the probability of that wasn't zero.

Celes won the tournament at Coudures.
#
And because of that, the Guild has recognized her
as the head of the Rococo family like they
promised.
#
The former apprentice who usurped the title had
no desire to make an enemy of the Guild and
returned it to her without a fuss.
#
She achieved her goal.
#
She was so happy, she was crying.
#
I patter her head and told her she did well too.
#
And...
#
Now that she's fulfilled her goal and reclaimed
her family home, what's she going to do next?
