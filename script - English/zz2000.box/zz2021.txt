"Aah...ah...mmm...mmm...aahhh...
 S-Such a brute.
 Be gentler...
 Ahhhh..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"If you really want me to be gentle, then maybe
 I should be."
#
As I say that, I violently pound her pussy.
#
<name "Rune" "!EA0308">
"Aaah...mmm...mmm...
 Honestly, you're such a bully."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Not half as much as you are."
#
I suck on her breast.
#
<name "Rune" "!EA0309">
"Heheh... Aah...
 Your teeth on my nipple... Honestly...
 Aaah...ah... Not just one of them...
 Ah...aah..."
#
I suck on her other breast like she wants.
#
<name "Rune" "!EA0310">
"Ah...ah...aah..."
#
She hugs me while focusing on the act.
#
<name "Rune" "!EA0311">
"Mm... D-Do it...
 Ah...aah..."
#
I move my hips harder and faster.
#
<name "Rune" "!EA0312">
"Aah...mmm...mmm...
 Mm... Yes...
 Mm...mmm!"
#
And quickly come inside her.
#
<background "ev076a2.iph" 10>
My dick spurts semen into her womb.
#
<name "Rune" "!EA0313">
"Mmmmm...mmm...mm...mmmmmmmmm..."
#
She shakes and has a small orgasm herself.
#
She squeezes tight on my dick the whole time I
come, never letting go as long as semen is 
shooting into her.
#
Once I finish, I start moving to come again.
#
<name "Rune" "!EA0318">
"Ah...ah...
 W-Wait...
 Aaah...aah...aaaah!"
#
She wants to enjoy the echoes of her orgasm, but
I don't stop moving.
#
I keep using my hips, hands, and mouth to savor
her entire body.
#
<background "ev076a3.iph" 10>
I let out a flood of semen, inside and outside of
her until I collapse into her chest.
#
We're both breathing hard.
#
As I settle down to the beating of her heart, the
scent of our sex tickles my nose.
#
That was pretty intense.
#
She holds me close.
#
<name "Rune" "!EA0316">
"Laz."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...Yeah?"
#
<name "Rune" "!EA0317">
"You're sometimes taking mana from other wizards,
 right?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...I know."
#
<music 11>
<background "bg018a0.iph" 11>
Having too much mana inside you poisons your body
and mind. Eventually, it'll kill you.
#
To keep that from happening, I have to constantly
release mana.
#
And I'm always taking mana from other wizards.
#
Some people think it's strange that I give and
take mana.
#
One of the properties of mana is that it wants to
accumulate.
#
Mana is like fire. 
The more mana there is, the more likely it is to
ignite.
#
The mana inside me is unstable, but if left
untouched, it'll try to take some kind of concrete
form.
#
If it does, it'll attract mana that's similar to
that form.
#
That's why I also need to take in mana that's not
like the kind inside me to keep my mana in flux.
#
The reason I have to take mana from other wizards
is to keep my mana from unstable.
#
That's why she and the Guild provide me women to
both take mana from as well as give it to.
#
It's in the Guild's interest too.
#
The wizards I give mana to become more capable and
powerful wizards. The mana I take remembers the
spells those wizards have and can be studied.
#
So far, it's been kept extremely secret, and it's
how the Guild has been stealing the spells and
knowledge that wizards and other organizations
have kept secret for centuries.
#
It's one of the biggest reasons the Guild's become
a force to be reckoned with.
#
What I gain from it is being able to manage the
mana inside me.
#
So I didn't argue about having sex with random
women.
#
...Until I fell in love with Viola.
#
<sprite "ta05a21.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Rune" "!EA0319">
"...I'm sorry about Viola.
 I knew how you felt, but I assigned you to the
 same unit anyway."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"That doesn't matter to me."
#
<sprite "ta05a20.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Rune" "!EA0320">
"I was upset...
 I was only thinking about you, not her."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
I wanted to have a talented wizard at my side.
#
Someone skilled enough to siphon off my 
considerable mana and convert it into magic.
#
<sprite "ta05a21.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Rune" "!EA0321">
"I didn't think there was a wizard alive who
 didn't desire you."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I don't know that I'd have been happy even if it
 had worked.
 She's a wizard who never needed me."
#
<sprite "ta05a12.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Rune" "!EA0323">
"Is that what made you love her?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
She was strong enough to not need me.
#
She was a natural wizard.
#
And I fell in love with her for that.
#
<sprite "ta05a07.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Rune" "!EA0324">
"By the way, you never fell in love with me?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"You didn't know?
 You were my first love."
#
<sprite "ta05a11.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Rune" "!EA0325">
"Oh my."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"What's that look?"
#
<sprite "ta05a13.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Rune" "!EA0326">
"Nothing. 
 So that's why you attacked me when you were
 young..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"L-Let's forget about the old days."
#
<sprite "ta05a07.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Rune" "!EA0327">
"Heheheh..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
She hugs me tight.
#
She was my first.
#
And she was also the first I gave mana to.
#
<sprite "ta05a10.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Rune" "!EA0328">
"Just kidding.
 Thank you."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...No, I'm sorry for saying something awkward
 like that."
#
<sprite "ta05a12.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Rune" "!EA0329">
"It's fine, but please remember."
#
<sprite "ta05a07.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Rune" "!EA0330">
"I want you to be happy.
 I don't want you to be doomed to misery because
 of the power you were born with."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah. I'll remember."
#
<sprite "ta05a12.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Rune" "!EA0331">
"Mm..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
She kisses me on the cheek and pats me on the
head.
