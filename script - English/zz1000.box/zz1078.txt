Elle left Loria.
#
She's making a living as a magical, and regular,
teacher in a small village.

"Hey, if you don't understand this place, you'll
 be in trouble later."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0890">
"Yes. That's right."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0891">
"If you keep working hard, you'll be able to
 become a fine wizard."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0892">
"Aim high, and don't give up."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0893">
"My goal?
 Become a court wizard, of course."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0894">
"But I'm going to make it on my own first."

Elle Bluetact.
#
She travels from place to place, constantly
researching and teaching magic as she goes.
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0895">
"I want everybody to become more familiar with
 magic."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"That's not a bad thing, but it could still be
 dangerous in the more rural areas."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0896">
"Yes, but if it wasn't, then it wouldn't be
 worth doing."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"You sound confident."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0897">
"No, I still have a ways to go, because I set my
 goal so high."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"A court wizard?"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0898">
"Yes. A court wizard like Miss Viola."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"That's even harder."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0899">
"That's a good thing.
 If it was easy, it'd be boring."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...True enough."
#
She actually technically became a court wizard
a couple years ago.
#
But she's continued to pursue her real ambition
and win the hearts of the people around her.

Elle Bluetact.
#
She travels from place to place, constantly
researching and teaching magic as she goes.
#
It's been a couple years since she became a court
wizard, but it's because of all her hard work.
#
She's especially popular among court wizards, and
has accomplished a lot.
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0900">
"I want everybody to become more familiar with
 magic."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"That's not a bad thing, but it could still be
 dangerous in the more rural areas."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0901">
"Certainly.
 It's common for them to throw spears or stones,
 offer gifts, whisper that I'm a devil, or
 stop their children from crying at night..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"S-Sounds rough."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0902">
"But I'm used to it."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I see."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0903">
"Yeah, oh, but when they offer sacrifices, that's
 a problem. I never know what to do when they
 offer up young men to me."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"What do you do?"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0904">
"Turn them down, of course.
 You don't like unfaithful girls, right?"
#
I pat her on the head.
