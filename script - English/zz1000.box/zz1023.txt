"Master..."

<name "Lazlocke">
"Hm?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA5073">
"A man's thing...
 Is everyone's so big?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I have no idea.
 I haven't seen very many others."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA5074">
"You haven't?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah. I've seen a few in public baths, but
 that's always when they're small."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA5075">
"I guess that makes sense."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Most of the women I've been with didn't have
 any experience with other men, so there's 
 nothing to compare with."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA5076">
"Um... what about the ones who have been with
 other men?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hmm... I've been called violent or a monster
 a lot, but I've never heard a complaint about
 the size."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA5077">
"I see."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...Don't get interested in other men."
#
I lightly bite her ass as I say that.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA5078">
"Oohh...
 Y-You're the only one who gets to be inside
 me."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Good answer."
#
Celes and I make love.
