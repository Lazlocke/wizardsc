"Hey, Celes.
 You look down.
 What's the matter?"

<name "Celes" "!AA7192">
"Oh, I'm in trouble with store debt.
 I was worrying about how I'd pay it off."

<sprite "ta02a09.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1205">
"What? That's easy."
#
<sprite "ta01b34.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7193">
"Eeh?
 It's a lot of money.
 What's easy about it?"

<sprite "ta02a00.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1206">
"I know a way to get rid of debt.
 Since I'm so kind, I can share it with you."
#
<sprite "ta02a10.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1207">
"Borrow more money."
#
<sprite "ta01b37.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7194">
"Eeh!?
 I can't!
 Nobody will lend to me."
#
<sprite "ta02a00.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1208">
"No, no. There's someone who will lend you.
 Ask that person."
#
<sprite "ta01b32.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7195">
"They won't lend me any more."
#
<sprite "ta02a09.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1209">
"Don't worry.
 They will."
#
<sprite "ta01b27.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7196">
"Why do you think that?"
#
<sprite "ta02a04.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1210">
"What'll they do if you die before paying off
 your debt?
 They won't get any of their money back."
#
<sprite "ta02a05.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1211">
"So you tell them that if they won't lend you any
 money, their business will fail.
 So they'll definitely lend you more."

<sprite "ta01b09.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7197">
"I see.
 Thank you, Elle."
#
<sprite "ta02a10.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1212">
"Hahaha.
 Just ask me again if you're ever in trouble."

"...What exactly was that all about?"
#
<sprite "ta01b15.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Celes" "!AA7198">
"We were practicing a play for the next bazaar."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I don't think that's a good lesson for kids.
 Although it is kind of true..."
#
By the way, they weren't allowed to perform any
more plays.
