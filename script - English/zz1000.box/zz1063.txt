Celes and Elle are running the obstacle course
together.
#
Celes is ahead and gets through the marsh.
#
Elle is behind her, still struggling with the
ropes across the ground.
#
Generally, Celes has the advantage.
#
Good.
#
I mean, that part's good.
#
That they're both trying hard.
#
That's great.
#
It's just...
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0227">
"Is there an issue?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Where would I begin?"
#
The obstacle course they're running is full of
actual obstacles.
#
A six foot sheer wall right after the start.
#
And then a rock carrying track, followed by 
having to cross hand over hand using a ladder
hung in the air.
#
Then through ropes spread over the ground, and
jumping over a marsh.
#
Then steep hills, followed by a sandy area.
#
And after putting on weighted boots, they have
to walk across a narrow plank.
#
This is all cruel.
#
After all that, five ten foot walls are set up
in a row.
#
It's like they're not supposed to reach the
finish line.
#
It's a straight shot to the end after that.
#
At least, it looks like you can just run, but
I'd bet anything that there are pitfalls hidden
there.
#
Aside from all that, there's another big
problem.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"When did you turn the yard into this?"
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0228">
"Earlier.
 They said they wanted to compete, so I helped
 them."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Oh?
 You did all this on your own?"
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0229">
"Some people from Guild Military helped."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I see.
 I'll want a list of their names later."
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0230">
"To thank them?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Do you think so?"
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0231">
"Yes.
 A thank you for helping in your apprentices'
 education.
 Don't you agree?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...Soshiette, let's go to my room so I can
 thank you properly."
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0232">
"Um..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I expect jubilation."
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0233">
"Yay."
#
I forcefully drag her inside.
#
Out in the yard, Celes yelps as she falls into
a pit.
