King of the hill, wizard style.
#
Normally, a little flag is put in a pile of
sand. The players take turns removing sand, and
whoever knocks over the flag loses.
#
But for wizards, you need to use magic to move
the sand.
#
It's a good game for young wizards since it's
rather difficult, requiring precise control of
your mana.
#
Don't underestimate it just because it's a game
for children.

<name "Elle" "!CA0082">
"Grr... You're good.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0703">
"Hahaha...
 It's your turn."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0083">
"Heheheh. Watch this.
 I'm quite confident in my control."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0704">
"O-Oh..."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0084">
"Hmph.
 How's that?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0705">
"Grrr..."
#
The pile looks the same, but she definitely
changed it.
#
She hollowed it from the inside out.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0706">
"..."
#
Celes takes a deep breath.
#
And then she strikes a pose.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0708">
"Impressive.
 I'd expect no less from my true rival."
#
Then she switches to a different pose.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0709">
"But it won't work on me!"
#
She uses magic to shave off the edges of the
pile.
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0085">
"No way!
 Cutting off the edges of a hollow mountain...
 That's suicide!"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0710">
"I know you'd think so, but..."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0086">
"It's not collapsing!
 How!?"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0087">
"Ah!"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0088">
"No way!"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0089">
"Every single grain of sand is put together in
 perfect balance!"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0711">
"Yes, that's right!"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0712">
"It's like having a brick wall of sand around
 the edge of the mountain!"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0713">
"It won't collapse!
 Go on, it's your turn!"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0090">
"Grr..."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0091">
"..."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0093">
"I would say I'm impressed, but you left an
 opening."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0714">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0094">
"How about this!?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0715">
"Aah!
 The sand brick I made...
 It's like a beehive!"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0095">
"This shape, the strength...
 There's nothing that gets past me!"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0716">
"Oh no...
 If I do that on my turn..."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0097">
"Go on, it's your turn."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0717">
"Grrr..."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0718">
"There's... nothing more I can do."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0719">
"Is that what you thought I'd say?"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0098">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0720">
"I knew you'd do that!
 Which is why I can shave down one more time!
 In the place where you made a cave!"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0099">
"What!?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0721">
"Take this!"
#
<background "ev054a2.iph" 10>
But the pile collapses and the flag falls.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0722">
"Huh?
 W-Why?"
#
She looks at it in complete astonishment.
#
She didn't mess up with the spell she cast.
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0100">
"Heheheh...
 Look carefully at where it collapsed."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0723">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0724">
"Aaah!
 Right there!"
#
A worm.
#
There's a worm!
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0725">
"When did that get there!?"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0101">
"When I took the sand out of the mountain, I
 left that in."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0726">
"O-Oh no!"
#
King of the hill...
#
Don't underestimate children's games.
