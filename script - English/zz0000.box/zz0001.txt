"You know, that girl who couldn't use magic?"
#
<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0342">
"Oh, that's her?
 She's still here?"

<name "Lazy Student" "!HA0312">
"I don't think so?"

<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0343">
"...What a disgrace."

<name "Lazy Student" "!HA0313">
"I know you don't like it, but don't glare.
 You'll get in trouble if a teacher sees you."

<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0344">
"I just want to have a little fun.
 Let's go."

"Geez.
 Let's not."

"Yes?"

"What are you doing here if you can't use magic?
 You're a disgrace. 
 Don't you have anywhere else to be?"

<name "Celes" "!AA7116">
"Um... I was told to wait here."
#
<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0347">
"I don't know who told you that, but I'm telling
 you that you're an eyesore.
 Get lost."

"Oh?"

"Who're you?"
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1432">
"Just a passing maid."

<sprite "ta01a08.iph" 2 5 12>

"Miss Soshiette."

<sprite "ta04a00.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1433">
"A friend of yours?"
#
<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0349">
"Hey. I don't know where you're from, but don't
 ignore me."
#
<sprite "ta04a28.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1434">
"We sound important.
 Who might we be?
 I don't recall any princesses who look like you."

"...Raging wind from the south..."

<name "Soshiette" "!DA1435">
"Are you attempting to cast a spell?
 Your training is clearly lacking if that's all it
 takes for you to lose your head."

"P-Please don't."

<sprite "ta04a15.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1436">
"Breathe another word, and I will kill you."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
As she says that, her hand snaps around the girl's
neck.
#
<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0353">
"Ggh!"
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1437">
"You know, it's against the rules to fight with
 magic."

She squeezes her hand and lifts.

<sprite "ta01a37.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Celes" "!AA7112">
"Miss Soshiette, you're choking her.
 She's going to die.
 Please let go."

"Ah...ah...ah..."
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1438">
"I suppose.
 It's not like me to pick on the feeble."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
She lets go and the girl falls to the floor.
#
<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0355">
"Agh...gah...
 W-Who are you?
 What the hell!?"
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1439">
"I'm not somebody you should concern yourself with
 knowing."

<name "Instructor" "!IA0256">
"Hey!
 What's going on here!?"
#
<name "Lazy Student" "!HA0315">
"Eep!
 Oh, no.
 It's a teacher."
#
<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0356">
"D-Don't worry.
 Ma'am, they were attacking me."

"How dare you raise your hands against students of
 this..."
#
<sprite "ta04a20.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1441">
"And what would you do if I did?"
#
<name "Instructor" "!IA0260">
"I'm so sorry!
 I see my students must have been bothering you!"
#
<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0357">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Instructor" "!IA0262">
"What did you do to her!?
 Just apologize at once!
 Apologize if you value your life!"
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1442">
"Just a little communication issue."
#
<name "Instructor" "!IA0263">
"T-Thank you for saying that."
#
<sprite "ta04a11.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1443">
"However, if it happens again, I will kill her.
 Of course, I'll be requesting you take official
 responsibility for their actions as well."
#
<name "Instructor" "!IA0266">
".........Eep."
#
<sprite "ta04a04.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1445">
"Now then, we're expected at a meeting.
 I believe that girl said it appropriately...
 You're an eyesore.
 Get lost."
#
<name "Instructor" "!IA0265">
"Y-Yes, ma'am!
 I'm very sorry!"
#
<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0358">
"M-Ma'am, what's going on!?
 That was just a maid!"
#
<name "Lazy Student" "!HA0316">
"J-Just drop it...
 That maid was no ordinary person."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
The teacher hurries the two girls away.
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1446">
"Exciting, isn't it?"

"U-Um, thank you.
 You rescued me."
#
<sprite "ta04a22.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1447">
"It was nothing.
 Well, they seem like they're having their own
 issues.
 Learning magic is a painful process."

<sprite "ta01a27.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7114">
"Yeah..."
#
<sprite "ta04a15.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA1448">
"However, I cannot accept the attitude of 
 oppressing the weak to make yourself feel better.
 You must bring down the hammer of justice on
 people like that."
#
<sprite "ta01a92.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7115">
"U-Um... The hammer of justice?"

"...Whew, we're alive."
#
<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0359">
"Ma'am, who was that maid?"
#
<name "Instructor" "!IA0268">
"You kids.
 If you're looking for a fight, be smarter about
 who you pick."
#
<name "Lazy Student" "!HA0317">
"Is she really that big a deal?"
#
<name "Instructor" "!IA0270">
"That's Soshiette, the combat instructor.
 She's who the principal here meets at the gate."
#
<name "Lazy Student" "!HA0318">
"Gah. Isn't that a wizard who reports directly to
 the Guild president?"
#
<name "Instructor" "!IA0271">
"That's right. If she's in a bad mood, she'll kill
 you on the spot."
#
<name "Lazy Student" "!HA0319">
"Scary."
#
<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0360">
"G-Grrr..."
#
<name "Lazy Student" "!HA0320">
"Then who was that girl she was with?"
#
<name "Instructor" "!IA0272">
"That was Mr. Lazlocke's apprentice, the man that
 even Soshiette bows her head to."
#
<name "Lazy Student" "!HA0321">
"...Who's Mr. Lazlocke?"
#
<name "Instructor" "!IA0273">
"Oh, you don't know about him.
 I guess he keeps a low profile."
#
<name "Lazy Student" "!HA0322">
"So, who is he?"
#
<name "Instructor" "!IA0274">
"The foremost apprentice of the Guild president.
 The only man of the Great Six.
 They say he's Ms. Viola's rival."
#
<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0361">
"..."
#
<name "Instructor" "!IA0275">
"Not somebody whose apprentice you want to pick a
 fight with, right?"
#
<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0362">
"........."
#
<name "Instructor" "!IA0276">
"Anyway, you're on toilet cleaning duty for a
 while.
 I don't want to die either."
#
<name "Lazy Student" "!HA0323">
"...Yes, ma'am.
 I'll do my best."
#
<name "Instructor" "!IA0277">
"And you?"
#
<name "Bratty Student" "!GA0363">
"T-This sucks!!!"
