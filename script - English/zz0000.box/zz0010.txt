"You think I monologue a lot?"

"There's a lot of exposition?"

"Whew... That feels better."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"By the way, Celes.
 Apparently, you were originally planned to be a
 pretty moody character."

<sprite "ta01a07.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7162">
"Huh? Oh, right.
 You mean like, the sullen and cold type?"
#

"Okay, let's try that out!"

<name "Celes" "!AA7163">
"Eeh!? 
 J-Just for a minute...
 Umm, then the line when I first met you.
 ...Ahem."

"Go away.
 If you're not a wizard, I don't want anything to

"And then after I reveal that I'm a wizard?"

<sprite "ta01a01.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Celes" "!AA7165">
"Teach me magic.
 I'll do anything."

<name "Celes" "!AA7166">
"S-Something like that?"

<name "Lazlocke">
"...I don't like it."

<sprite "ta01a10.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7167">
"Eeeh!?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"The reason it was rejected is because it didn't
 work well for comedy."

<sprite "ta01a41.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7168">
"Awww...
 I guess so, but..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"If you have something to say, out with it."
#
<sprite "ta01a15.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7169">
"I'm glad I am the way I am.
 I'm happy I get to do comedy."
