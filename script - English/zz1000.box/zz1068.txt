Celes still had a lot to learn, so she remained
my apprentice.

<name "Celes" "!AA6509">
"Master...
 Yah...hya...yah..."
#
...
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6510">
"M-Master, lower your head a little more."
#
She's carrying dishes with magic.
#
She's learned a lot of magic for fighting, but
she wants to learn much more than that.
#
This is the first step.

"This is a risky kind of training.
 If you mess up, you lose your dinner."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6511">
"Y-Yes, I'm aware."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"And why do I have to be a part of it?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6512">
"M-Master and apprentice... should share their
 fates..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Oh?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6513">
"Aah! Don't move.
 Aaah! Ah! Oh! Eeek!"

Celestine Rococo is anything but an exemplary
wizard, and her name definitely isn't going to go
down in history.
#
As a wizard, she's average at best.
#
But she didn't grieve or lament it.
#
She demonstrated her own perseverance and 
continued striving to be an above-average wizard.
#
I took on odd jobs from the Guild as I helped my
only apprentice, and lead a carefree life.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6514">
"Master, the dinner's cold."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Then you should have carried it quicker."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6515">
"Grrr...
 I'll try harder next time."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah."
#
I pat her on the head and take a bite of my cold
dinner.
