A special association of students.
#
After being with me over and over, they grew as
wizards, crackling with mana.
#
And then they became leading members of the Guild.
#
That feast of madness keeps going on, even as the
members change.
#
<name "Mel" "!MB0014">
"When's the next one?"
#
<name "Marcia" "!JB0015">
"Um... The beginning of next month, I think?
 But it depends on Lazlocke."
#
<name "Tris" "!KB0009">
"Aww... I can't wait."
#
<name "Mel" "!MB0015">
"Can't wait? You were with him so much last time.
 It wasn't fair.
 I only got it twice."
#
<name "Marcia" "!JB0016">
"I had three times, but Tris, you had six, right?
 I'm so jealous."
#
<name "Tris" "!KB0010">
"Hahaha..."
#
Even if they have enough mana to not need to
participate, they're still welcome to ask.
#
Although as more and more people join, that
brings its own problems.
