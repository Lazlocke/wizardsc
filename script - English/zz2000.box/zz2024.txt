A wizard is before me, bound and stark naked.
#
Her restraints are magical.
#
She's suspended in the air, keeping her from 
being able to move.
#
She's held up, and completely helpless.
#
On top of that, the mana inside her and the mana
in the room is being constantly suppressed.
The spells to do so are being activated over and
over.
#
It's taking a few wizards to keep this setup
running.
#
Which just shows how dangerous this bound wizard
is.
#
Macornel Makolner.
#
The Makolner family is a famous clan of wizards
going back centuries. The current head of the
family is said to be the finest wizards the family
has seen in generations.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0000">
"I won't give in to the Guild.
 Leave me alone."
#
According to the report, this is the seventeenth
day of her imprisonment.
#
They've been feeding her and forcing her to eat
to keep her alive, but she's got a lot of 
willpower to have been able to endure this for
as long as she has.
#
Which is why I've been called in.
#
I approach her to get this done quickly.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...This is your final offer.
 Submit the research you were working on to the
 Guild, and assist the Guild from now on."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0001">
"I refuse."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...That may be a hasty decision."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0002">
"Hmph.
 Anyway, you can't kill me.
 You're after my research."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0003">
"I'm still alive because you need me alive.
 How many wizards are you using to keep me
 imprisoned here?
 What a joke."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"A joke, huh?
 I see."
#
I reach out and violently touch her pussy.
#
<background "ev079a1.iph" 10>
<name "Macornel" "!PB0004">
"Ngh!
 Ah! Agh!
 W-What are you doing!?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Your sensations have been enhanced multiple times
 over.
 Enjoy it."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0005">
"Ah! Ah! Aaaah!
 Damn it!
 Don't think this is enough to beat me!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"No wizard would give in to just that.
 What are you even talking about?"
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0006">
"Aaaaaaaaaagh!!!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I still need to go shopping for dinner before
 I go home.
 Let's make this quick."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0007">
"Ah! W-What?
 Ah! Aaaaaaahhhh!!!"
#
I bring my face to her pussy and use my tongue
to rub my saliva over her entrance.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0008">
"Aaaaaaahhhh!!!"
#
Because of the magic enhancing what she's feeling,
almost instantly, love juice pours out of her.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0009">
"Ah...ah...aah...aaah!
 Aah! Aaah! Aaaaahh...
 D-Damn it... Y-You bastard...
 Aaaaah...aaaaaah!!!"
#
I keep stimulating her until her juices are 
running down her thighs and onto the floor, then
I take my dick out of my pants.
#
It's hard enough.
I can put it in her.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"It's lucky you've never been with a man.
 If you had, this would've taken twice as many 
 people."
#
As I say that, I press myself against her
entrance.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0010">
"Ah...aah...ngh..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Well, this is still cruel enough..."
#
I slowly push my dick into her.
#
<background "ev079a2.iph" 10>
<name "Macornel" "!PB0011">
"Nnnnnhhhhhh!!!"
#
My dick forces its way into her narrow pussy.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0012">
"Aaah! Ah! Aaahh!"
#
Even despite all her love juices lubricating her,
she writhes in pain from my dick wrenching her
open.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0013">
"Ah! Aah! Aaaaaaahhhh!!!"
#
It's also that all her sensations are being
enhanced right now.
#
This much pain is probably enough to make most
people faint.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0014">
"Ah! Agh!
 Aaaaggghhhhh!!!"
#
I break through her hymen and reach the back of
her pussy.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0015">
"Ngh!!!
 Aaaah!!!"
#
But I keep pushing deeper into her until I'm
completely buried inside her.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0016">
"Ah...ah...ah...aah...aaah...
 Nnnh...agh...aahh..."
#
My dick gets bigger and harder as it slides
through her walls, coated in her slick juices.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0017">
"Ah...aah...agh...aah..."
#
She bears the pain of my dick in her pussy as
best she can.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0018">
"Aah...ah...ah...ah...
 T-This is... your cruelty!?
 Don't make me laugh!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"This isn't what I meant.
 Well, you'll see soon enough."
#
I pull my dick back and then push it back in.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0019">
"Ngh!"
#
She gasps voicelessly.
#
I do it again.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0020">
"Nh!
 Nnhh!!!"
#
Violently.
Just to stimulate my dick.
#
I keep moving my hips, rubbing myself inside her.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0021">
"Aah! Aaah!!!"
#
She screams and spits every time I move, but she
can't resist.
#
All she can do is dangle before me.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0022">
"Aaaah! Aah!
 Aahhhh! Aaaaahhhh!"
#
I thrust for my pleasure, listening to her
tortured screams.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0023">
"Ah! Ah! Aaah! Ah! Aaah!
 Aah! Ah! Aaah! Stop! Aaaahhh!!!"
#
She's helpless to do anything but endure the
disgrace of being violated.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0024">
"Aaah...
 Aaaahhhhhh!!!"
#
She can't pass out.
#
If she did, that would only make it hurt more.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0025">
"Aaaaaagh!!!"
#
The pain that seems like it will go on forever
for her suddenly stops.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0026">
"Ah...ah...ah..."
#
As she wonders if it's over, I begin to come.
#
My dick spurts and stains the inside of her
pussy.
#
<background "ev079a3.iph" 10>
<name "Macornel" "!PB0027">
"Ah...ah..."
#
My semen floods her pussy and her whole body
convulses as it beats against her womb.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0028">
"Ah...aahh...aaaahhhhh!!!
 I-I'll kill you!
 I'm going to kill you!"
#
She glares at me and rages as I come inside her.
#
I placidly ignore her.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"You're pretty sexy when you're gasping for
 breath.
 Or am I seeing things?"
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0029">
"I-I swear I'll kill you!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Since you've still got so much energy, hang in
 there a little longer.
 Yeah, I'm going to do this until you piss
 yourself."
#
I keep fucking her until she can't control
herself.
#
<background "bg024a0.iph" 10>
<background "ev079a0.iph" 10>
<name "Lazlocke">
"...You awake yet?"
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0030">
"Ah...aah...ah...
 Huh?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I've removed the spell on your body."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0031">
"Ah..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I can't remove the restraints, but I released
 the spell binding the mana inside you.
 How are you feeling?"
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0032">
"W-Why?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Because there's no need for it anymore."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0033">
"...W-What?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I told you already, there's no need.
 I have the magical research you were doing."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0034">
"T-That's impossible...
 I didn't say anything..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"You didn't say anything?
 What about this?"
#
I magically sketch a diagram in the air in front
of her.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0035">
"Ah!"
#
The diagram is part of the magic she's been
researching.
#
This should be the key part of it.
#
It's probably something her family's been cooking
up and working on for generations.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0036">
"Where did you get that!?
 How!?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...I knew you'd never tell me.
 Probably some kind of self-hypnosis."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0037">
"..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"So I had your mana tell me."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0038">
"My mana?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"That's right."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"The mana inside you remembers the magic you've
 done, and the magic that's been passed on for
 generations is especially clear."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0039">
"That's not possible..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Haven't you ever wondered how the Guild has
 accumulated so much power over the last decade
 or so?"
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0040">
"Ah..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"That's right.
 They take magic like this."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0041">
"T-That's... impossible."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"What is this before you?"
#
I bring the diagram right to her.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0042">
"Ah...aah..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"And you're going to forget what this is.
 Take a good look at it.
 You should know it perfectly, but aren't pieces
 of it already starting to get hazy?"
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0043">
"Ah...ah..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"The more you look at it, the more you realize
 you're forgetting it."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0044">
"I-Impossible..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"It's useful to take magic from mana, but the
 problem with it is that it takes the magic away
 from whoever originally had it."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0045">
"No..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Well, you can always study it again.
 It should only take a few more generations."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0046">
"Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I warned you it was cruel."
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0047">
"N-No! No!
 Noooooooooo!!!!!
 Give it back! Give it back!
 Give it back!!!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I refuse."
#
In fact, while it's true that I can read magic
from mana, I lied when I said that doing that
would steal it from her.
#
If losing your mana took the knowledge and
experience needed to cast it, then almost every
wizard would have to start from scratch every
time they cast a spell.
#
Her memory of it is messed up because the mana
was forcibly and quickly drained out of her.
#
What's more, she's panicking because of that
diagram I showed her from stealing her mana and
not thinking straight.
#
I can read it from her mana, but there's no
explanations or notes that come with it.
#
All I can do is reproduce the diagram and spell
the way it's recorded in her mana.
#
I have no idea whatsoever what it means or what
it's for.
#
It'd take a very long time to research that and
figure it out.
#
That's a hassle neither the Guild nor I want.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0048">
"Please... Please...
 I'll do anything...
 Aaahh..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...You'll listen to me?"
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0049">
"I-I'm listening.
 Anything you ask."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"You'll join the Guild?"
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0050">
"I will!
 I will!"
#
I release her restraints.
#
<name "Macornel" "!PB0051">
"Ah..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I'll need to have sex with you again to give
 it back."
#
When she realizes what I said, she lays down
shamefully and slowly opens her legs.
#
Very well behaved now.
#
I play with the desperate woman until dawn comes.

"Well done."

<name "Lazlocke">
"I'm used to it."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
This is the secret method that the Guild has
used to force wizards into the fold.
#
It only works on women, but at least a dozen
have been dealt with this way so far.
#
It's definitely one of the big reasons why the
Guild has been able to explosively expand its
influence in recent years.
#
<sprite "ta04a02.iph" 4 4 11>

<sprite "ta04a03.iph" 4 4 12>

"I believe you could have actually gotten rid
 of that magic.
 Why didn't you?"

...

"...I don't like trouble.
 It's better if she cooperates."
#
<sprite "ta04a02.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0967">
"That may be, but she has a rebellious spirit.
 She may behave now, but it's possible she'll
 rebel again in the future."
#
<sprite "ta04a01.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0962">
"In her case, I think that taking her magic and
 expelling it would have been the correct 
 approach."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"She may be rebellious, but she didn't do anything
 wrong.
 We're the bad guys here."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"We're taking the knowledge and traditions they
 created and forcing her to share them with every
 other wizard, and if they say no, forcing them
 to do it, and stealing it if they resist."

"We're worse than bandits.
 Of course they resist."

"Don't be mad at me.
 I'm the Guild's thief.
 You're the Guild's killer.
 It's the truth, yeah?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"So I won't betray the Guild.
 Not anymore..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
Yeah, not anymore.

I've done too much harm to stop now, and sinned
too much to start atoning.
