Soshiette came onto me, and now we're having sex.
#
I've already come in her twice, but I'm still
moving my hips, not satisfied yet.
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0834">
"Ah...ah...mmm...
 Doing it like this... reminds me of the old
 days."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"The old days?"
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0835">
"Yes. Mm...
 The first time I met you..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"The first time, huh?"
#
<background "ev090a1.iph" 10>
It was when I had run away from the Guild and was
in hiding in a mountain village.
#
Soshiette was the commander of a task force sent
to hunt me down.
#
Since she and everyone she was with were dressed
like maids, I thought that's just what they were.
#
Not that I had any idea why there was a bunch of
maids wandering around.
#
But it was obvious they were my enemy.
#
<background "ev090a0.iph" 10>
They didn't give any chance to talk it out.
All of a sudden, the house I was staying in was
surrounded, and they rushed in, weapons drawn.
#
So I counterattacked, without mercy.
#
She came with fifteen others.
#
So including her, it was an ambush by sixteen
wizards.
#
If they just sent regular soldiers, I could've
been in danger.
#
But because they were wizards, they never stood
a chance.
#
I had been hiding from the Guild, and hadn't been
expelling my mana.
I was like a powder keg of mana.
#
I barely even needed to try to take away the mana
from anybody who got close.
#
Wizards have a lot of mana, so when I take it from
them, I take a lot.
#
Taking mana from someone is like knocking the
wind out of them.
Taking a lot all at once is liable to knock most
people right out.
#
Even the ones who stay conscious are thrown for a
loop.
#
My magic basically exploded against the mass of
mana that came rushing at me.
#
I thought that would be enough to repel them, but
Soshiette avoided it.
#
However, she's still a wizard.
#
Having her mana taken from her stunned her and
slowed her down.
#
So I attacked again.
#
Directed at just her.
#
She fearlessly slashed at me with her knives, but
my magic hit her dead on.
#
The impact of the spell shattered her blades.
#
It stopped her in her tracks for just a moment.
#
She dropped her knives and came at me barehanded,
but by then, it was too late, and I had finished
my next spell.
#
<background "ev073a0.iph" 10>
<name "Lazlocke">
"You were pretty brave."
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0836">
"Aaah...mmm...mmm...
 Your Grace, you were... 
 Ah...mm...mmm...ÅÙ"
#
It wasn't until afterwards that I realized they
were all women.
#
And I remembered.
#
I remembered how I expel mana.
#
I'm normally not like that, but I think the blood
might have gone from my head after being the 
target of an assassination attempt.
#
Or maybe it was my survival instinct.
#
I raped all of them, one by one, giving back at
least twice the mana I took from any of them.
#
<background "ev073a1.iph" 10>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0837">
"Mm...ah...ah...aah...ah..."
#
Even after going through sixteen women, my mana
wasn't exhausted, and my lust, inflamed by the
surplus of mana, wasn't subsiding.
#
I spent two weeks with them.
#
And then the Guild captured me.
#
I should've realized that all sixteen of them were
beatuiful, young women, and virgins at that, but
I didn't suspect anything.
#
They may not have even known it themselves that
they were bait to catch me.
#
While I was busy with them, the Guild had 
dispatched over a hundred wizards to bring me in.
#
At the head of it was the leader of the Guild.
#
At her sides were my fellow apprentices, Henrietta
and Keima.
#
A terrifying array of magical power.

"Soshiette."

<background "ev073a2.iph" 10>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0838">
"Aah...
 Yes?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...I must have terrified you back then, huh?"
#
I kiss her.
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0839">
"Mm..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I'm who I am now because you came.
 You saved me."
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0840">
"Mmmm!ÅÙ
 That's right... Ahhh...
  Back then, I was scared."
#
Any woman would be scared of a man who attacks her
by force.
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0841">
"Mm...ah... No, more then when you violated me...
 Aah...
 When I faced you..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hm? You were that scared then?"
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0842">
"Yes... Mmm...
 When I entered the hut, I thought I had failed."
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0843">
"Aah...mmm...
 We had the numbers, I thought we could... mmm...
 capture you without a struggle...
 I've never been... mmm... as wrong as then..."
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0852">
"And... mmm... I was intending to kill you..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"You were?"
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0845">
"I'm sorry.
 But at the time..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Don't worry about it.
 This is our relationship now."
#
I move my hips and stimulate her pussy.
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0853">
"Aaah...mm...ah...
 At the time... ah... I had never regretted any
 job I took."
#
I kiss her again in apology.
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0847">
"Your Grace... Mmm... I-I can't... take much
 more..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...Thinking about the old days is making me feel
 like kind of a brute."
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0848">
"Being a brute is... mm... wonderful."
#
I pound her intensely like she wants.
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0849">
"Ah! Ah! Ahh! Ah! Ah! Aah! Ahh!
 Aahh! Mm! Mm! Ah! Ah! Aah!"
#
I don't know how much of a brute I'm being, but I
intensely stir her pussy and come hard for a third
time.
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0850">
"Mmmmmmm!ÅÙ"
#
She shudders and quivers, coming herself, as she
takes my semen into her.

"By the way, Your Grace."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yes?"
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0855">
"The security division is requesting a meeting 
 with you.
 Please check your calendar."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hmm..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
The maids who ended up as bait for me back then
form the backbone of the Guild's current security
division.
#
The meeting is just a pretext.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...Whatever you say.
 You'll be there too?"
#
<sprite "ta04a62.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0856">
"Of course."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I don't have the endurance I used to, you know."
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0857">
"Please leave the scheduling to me.
 How does three people a day across six days
 sound?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
Three a day, so fifteen people across five days,
huh?
#
And then the sixth day is probably just her.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...All right.
 I'll let you take care of everything."
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0859">
"Yes, Your Grace."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
She answers with a smile from ear to ear.
#
The first time I met her, when she was rushing
in to kill me, I never imagined seeing her like
this.
