"About?"

<sprite "ta01a08.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7124">
"Your mana.
 Couldn't you release it with a paper drive like
 Elle uses?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Oh, you mean expel the mana ahead of time?"
#
<sprite "ta01a15.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7125">
"Yes.
 It seems like a good idea to me."

<name "Celes" "!AA7126">
"What's more, you could sell it.
 You could get rich in no time."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Unfortunately, it wouldn't work."

<sprite "ta01a10.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7127">
"Eeh!?
 Why not?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Because of how my body gathers mana, I can't use
 paper drives very well."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"It'd be like, for example, throwing dominos in
 front of a vacuum cleaner."

<sprite "ta01a08.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7128">
"I see!
 What an easy to understand example!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"By the way, that analogy doesn't fit the setting,
 so that's why it couldn't be part of the main
 game."
#
<sprite "ta01a92.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7129">
"I see.
 What a sad reason."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Indeed."
