 While this is the reserved time for women without

"You're right.
 Maybe just free time then?"

 I had a nice idea though.
 There is one thing that could make this corner

Rune Whoever
#
Well, I spent the rest of my life uneventfully in
Guild headquarters.
#
I just pray that I barely ever see her.
#
<sprite "ta05a12.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Rune" "!EA0566">
"My, my, Laz.
 What's with Rune Whoever?
 And that's quite the story too."

Lazlocke Blah
#
Well, he probably tried his best.
#
He died making fun of two women.
#
Perhaps respectable as a comedian.
#
But a foolish way to die.
