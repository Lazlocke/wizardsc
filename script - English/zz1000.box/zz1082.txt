Viola Entra.
#
Her name will go down in history as both a court
wizard of Queensbell, and a master politician.
#
It's said that she alone is responsible for
lengthening the reign of the kingdom for another
two centuries.
#
She could even become the head of the Guild in
the future, but who can say?

<name "Viola" "!BA1066">
"Speaking of which, I heard the Guild was planning
 some kind of unsavory event."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah. Research and Preservation are cooking
 something up.
 I don't know the details."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1067">
"Well, nothing good comes when those two get
 together."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Seriously.
 I'd keep away from the Guild for a while."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1068">
"Unfortunately, I can't.
 I have a lot of chores."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Too bad."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1069">
"Certainly, but the same goes for you."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1070">
"They told me to drag you in, and I wouldn't
 try running if I were you."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"..."
#
Viola and I will stay close friends for a long 
time.
