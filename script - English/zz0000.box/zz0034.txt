"Who is this who has a stand image!?
 You all want to know!"
#
<name "Young Man" "!SB9011">
"I shall tell you!"
#
<name "Young Man" "!SB9013">
"Just Passerby A!"
#
<name "Young Man" "!SB9014">
"Aha! You probably thought there's no way that
 Passerby A would have a stand image!"
#
<name "Young Man" "!SB9016">
"But I do!"
#
<name "Young Man" "!SB9017">
"Why!?"
#
<name "Young Man" "!SB9018">
"Because I'm special!
 Yes, I'm special!"
#
<name "Young Man" "!SB9019">
"The proof is in the detailed settings!
 My name is Hale Hord, twenty seven years old!"
#
<name "Young Man" "!SB9020">
"My wife is Ralhu.
 No children.
 Married three years."
#
<name "Young Man" "!SB9021">
"Job, general store employee!
 My future dream is to own my own store.
 My catchphrase is 'I have a good idea.'"
#
<name "Young Man" "!SB9022">
"Right now, I'm keeping it a secret that I'm
 learning agriculture from my wife because I'm
 thinking about changing jobs."
#
<name "Young Man" "!SB9023">
"How about that!?
 I've got more of a backstory than Recchino or
 Reno!"
#
<name "Young Man" "!SB9024">
"So why am I resigned to just be a passerby!?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA9155">
"Because you have nothing to do with me?"
#
<name "Young Man" "!SB9026">
"That's correct!
 Sob..."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA9156">
"Actually, it was supposed to be used for a drunk,
 but then it was weird to have a stand image just
 for some random drunkard."
#
<name "Young Man" "!SB9027">
"This sucks..."
