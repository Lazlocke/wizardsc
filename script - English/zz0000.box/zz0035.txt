"Heheheh.
 Hello, Puschel here."
#
<sprite "ta15a04.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9057">
"Yay!"
#
<sprite "ta15a21.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9058">
"Since I managed to get my very own corner,
 I have to do something special.
 I haven't forgotten my fanservice spirit.ÅÙ"
#
<sprite "ta15a05.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9059">
"So, I'll use this corner to explain the basics
 about wizards in Loria."
#
<sprite "ta15a13.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9060">
"I say explain, but there's not actually much to
 go over."
#
<sprite "ta15a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9061">
"First, here in Loria is where the Wizard's Guild
 headquarters is located."
#
<sprite "ta15a03.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9062">
"So it's kind of like the central city for
 wizards."
#
<sprite "ta15a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9063">
"They say that only one in a thousand is a wizard,
 but there are more than a thousand wizards in
 this city alone.
 It's kind of incredible."
#
<sprite "ta15a05.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9064">
"Just to give a few famous examples, there's 
 Rune, the president of the Guild, and Viola, a
 court wizard."
#
<sprite "ta15a21.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9065">
"Also, the sleeping kitty, Lazlocke Althorn.
 As for me, I'm just a lazybones."
#
<sprite "ta15a25.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9066">
"Henrietta Bevels also left the wizard life here.
 Those four are some of the best on the whole
 continent. Even I don't want to make enemies of
 them."
#
<sprite "ta15a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9067">
"If you call those four people A-ranked, there are
 about ten others at a similar level.
 Well, most of them stay shut up in their homes
 and just do research."
#
<sprite "ta15a21.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9069">
"But, you know, there's a bunch of B-ranked people
 under the A-rank."
#
<sprite "ta15a26.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9070">
"I, of course, am B-rank.
 I'm not too proud to admit that."
#
<sprite "ta15a25.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9071">
"Other well known people include the secretary 
 of the Guild, and Soshiette the combat 
 instructor. Probably the rest of the court 
 wizards besides Viola, I guess."
#
<sprite "ta15a27.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9072">
"Hendrick, Recchino, Ingway, and Ren are B-rank
 too, but only just barely."
#
<sprite "ta15a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9074">
"Recchino and Ingway are more of the martial
 artist and archer types, but they're skilled
 enough with magic too."
#
<sprite "ta15a25.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9075">
"B-rank is the level where you can take it to the
 battlefield.
 C-rank is still studying."
#
<sprite "ta15a21.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9076">
"That's people like magic library staff, Guild
 staff, so on and so forth."
#
<sprite "ta15a25.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9077">
"Oh, and students at the magic school are below
 even C-rank, so don't get that wrong."
#
<sprite "ta15a05.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9078">
"Well, it's because there are so many wizards in
 the city that it's like this."
#
<sprite "ta15a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9079">
"That's why the wizard tournaments and martial 
 arts tournaments are so popular."
#
<sprite "ta15a06.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9080">
"There's also a lot of weird research that goes
 on, and strange things happen every day."
#
<sprite "ta15a04.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9082">
"People in the city have gotten used to odd
 things."
#
<sprite "ta15a21.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9084">
"In rural areas, wizards are still feared, so it's
 unusual for wizards to be as free as they are 
 here."
#
<sprite "ta15a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9085">
"That may also be why the Wizard's Guild is here."
#
<sprite "ta15a27.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9086">
"Well, there's more I wanted to cover, but it
 looks like we're out of time."
#
<sprite "ta15a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Puschel" "!SA9087">
"That's all for now.
 See you another time, another place."
