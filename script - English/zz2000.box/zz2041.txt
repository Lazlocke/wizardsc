It's a place where various demons congregate.

<name "Miss Horn" "!MC0000">
"So, how is it going?"
#
She enters the spring and washes herself.
#
<name "Silver Fox" "!HC0098">
"How is what going?"
#
She's sitting by the spring.
#
Both of them are naked.
#
<name "Miss Horn" "!MC0001">
"You know what I mean."
#
<name "Silver Fox" "!HC0099">
"Well enough, I suppose."
#
<name "Miss Horn" "!MC0002">
"I see. I wish I could help you."
#
<name "Silver Fox" "!HC0100">
"It's fine.
 This is my problem."
#
<name "Miss Horn" "!MC0003">
"...I suppose, but it does make me feel a little
 lonesome."
#
<name "Silver Fox" "!HC0101">
"I'm sorry."
#
<name "Miss Horn" "!MC0004">
"Don't say things you don't believe.
 You don't care a thing about me."
#
<name "Silver Fox" "!HC0102">
"Heheh...
 That's not true."
#
<name "Miss Horn" "!MC0005">
"Same liar as ever."
#
<name "Silver Fox" "!HC0103">
"I'm not lying.
 You're my precious best friend.
 Could you wash my back and tail?"
#
<name "Miss Horn" "!MC0006">
"Yeah, yeah.
 Abusing your best friend as always."
#
She carefully cleans her back and tail.
#
<name "Miss Horn" "!MC0008">
"Your tails always look so beautiful."
#
<name "Silver Fox" "!HC0104">
"Thank you."
#
<name "Miss Horn" "!MC0009">
"But they've lost the sheen that they used to 
 have."
#
<name "Silver Fox" "!HC0105">
"Grr..."
#
<name "Miss Horn" "!MC0010">
"You've used them too much.
 Well, I know you won't listen to me if I told
 you to stop."
#
<name "Miss Horn" "!MC0011">
"Just one thing."
#
<name "Silver Fox" "!HC0106">
"What is it?"
#
<name "Miss Horn" "!MC0012">
"Don't rush."
#
<name "Silver Fox" "!HC0107">
"...I know."
#
The two bathe in silence after that.
