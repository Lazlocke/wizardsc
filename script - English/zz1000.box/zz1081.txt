"Tea."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I just made it."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1052">
"Oh? For me?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I had a hunch you'd be coming by."
#
I pour a cup of tea for her.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"How was the capital?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1053">
"The king's easy going, so it was easy enough.
 The economy's stable too."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1054">
"The problem are the idiots who don't understand
 the benefits of having a king like that."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"The fact that you're here drinking tea at my
 place while saying that means that you've got
 it under control, doesn't it?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1055">
"Yes. They'll all be arrested by the end of the
 month, with legitimate charges."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I see.
 Then there aren't enough trusted advisors
 around the king?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1056">
"That's what gives me a migraine.
 I may need to pull some in from the Guild."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Sounds rough."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1057">
"You could come."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Haha. I'll think about it."

Viola Entra.
#
Her name will go down in history as both a court
wizard of Queensbell, and a master politician.
#
It's said that she alone is responsible for
lengthening the reign of the kingdom for another
two centuries.
#
She could even become the head of the Guild in
the future, but who can say?
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1058">
"I'll be in Loria for a while."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Isn't the capital better?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1059">
"It's more peaceful without me around."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Really?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1060">
"A lot of people get restless around me.
 For a number of reasons."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Sounds rough."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1061">
"That in itself is entertaining, but the chaos
 has gotten irritating. I think I need to ask
 Guild Intelligence to sniff out some leverage."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"So you left the capital to get them to relax
 their guard?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1062">
"Precisely.
 So let's just relax for a while."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1063">
"And, thank you for everything."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Everything?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1064">
"Like dinner."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, yeah.
 I'll go get it ready."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1065">
"It'd be nice if I could just stay here though."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, yeah.
 Like you'd even let me say no."
#
My friendly relationship with her is going to
last a very long time.
