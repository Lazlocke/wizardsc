"The Guild again?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"It's work. There's not much I can do about it."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1029">
"You could say no."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Easier said than done."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1030">
"If it's mana, I already said that I'd take care
 of all of that."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, but..."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1031">
"Grr..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Are you mad?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1032">
"I am mad."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I see.
 You know, I know how to cheer you up right away."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1033">
"Whatever you do, I won't be in a good mood."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"We could sleep, holding hands."

<name "Viola" "!BA1034">
"........."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"No?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1035">
"I-I didn't say no!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I see.
 Then try to feel better."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1036">
"F-Fine."

Viola Entra.
#
She became my wife, while remaining a court
wizard, and we've been living the peaceful
married life.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"By the way..."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1037">
"What?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"When'd you feelings for me change?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1038">
"When you went away."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Meaning... after the fight at the Terol
 Mountains?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1039">
"Yeah. When I heard you were gone, I didn't
 think much about it, but, um, that was when I
 started worrying..."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1040">
"I went out looking for you several times."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I see..."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1041">
"When you came back, um, I was going to tell you
 how I felt..."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1042">
"I said horrible things to you."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, that hurt."
#
It doesn't matter how you feel about me.
It doesn't matter what you think is right or
wrong.
#
You need to have sex with me to give me mana.
#
You get to have sex with the one you love.
You should have no problem with it.
Or do you no longer fancy me?
#
...Do you hate me?
#
What is there to love?
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1043">
"I'm sorry."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...It's fine. Don't worry about it."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1044">
"But I regretted what I said for a long time."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1045">
"Whenever I thought about telling you myself, I
 felt weak at the knees."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1046">
"And I got scared."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1047">
"I wanted to tell you, but I never could."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1048">
"I wish I could take back what I said."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...I love you.
 Even if I didn't have my power, even if you
 weren't a wizard."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I even respect your honesty and directness."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1049">
"...Thank you."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Is that what you should say to your husband?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1050">
"...I love you."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Me too."
