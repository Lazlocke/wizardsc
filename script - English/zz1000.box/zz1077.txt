As a court wizard.

Elle Bluetact.
#
She's no Viola, but she's made her name known
inside Queensbell and in the surrounding kingdoms
as a mover and shaker.
#
And if we're talking as a statesman, she's got
more influence than Viola does.
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0878">
"Well, the reason I became a court wizard is
 because of the personal recommendations from
 Miss Viola and the Guild."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0879">
"I have to put in the work so as not to shame
 them."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"That's the spirit."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0880">
"And, you know, I needed to ask a favor."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"What is it?"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0881">
"Can I sometimes come see you like this?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, I don't mind."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0883">
"And, um... be with me too."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hmm... I thought you didn't need that any more."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0884">
"Being a court wizard is very stressful."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I can imagine it.
 All right. I'll think about it."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0885">
"Don't think.
 Please promise me."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"All right.
 It's probably okay."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0886">
"Then, let's get right to it."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Right to it?
 Sounds like stress is already getting to you."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0887">
"Yep.ÅÙ"
