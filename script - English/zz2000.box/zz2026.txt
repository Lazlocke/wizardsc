"Ah! Aah! Ahh! Aah!"
#
I'm having sex with the princess of the Krun
Empire.
#
She's a prisoner, and my only relationship with
her is taking her mana.
#
I violently thrust my dick into this pitiable
girl.
#
I've done this to her many times now.
#
Eventually, she submitted to me.
#
I'm not sure whether she's actually given up,
or is just trying to find a way to cope with the
pain.
#
But little by little, as she stopped resisting,
her restraints were removed, and right now,
there's nothing binding her.
#
I thought she'd attack once everything was taken
off, but she didn't.
#
Right now, the only thing she has is a regular
collar that doesn't have any magical effect at
all.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"You've become pretty docile."
#
<name "Lynth" "!NB0022">
"Ah...ah...mmm...mmm..."
#
She doesn't respond.
#
Not because she's resisting, but because she's
focused on having sex.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I'm going to come."
#
I know she's not listening, but I move faster to
come inside her pussy.
#
<background "ev081a2.iph" 10>
<name "Lynth" "!NB0023">
"Ah! Ah! Ah! Aah! Aahhhhhhh!!!ÅÙ"
#
She comes right after me.
#
A gush of her fluid floods out of her and stains
the bed.
#
<name "Lynth" "!NB0024">
"Ah...aaah...aahhh...ah..."
#
But she doesn't care about that, and rocks her
hips, wanting more.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"..."
#
I don't have much choice.
I move my hips and stir up her pussy.
#
<name "Lynth" "!NB0026">
"Aaaaahhh! Mm! Mmm! Mmm! Aaah!
 Aaah! Aaah! Aahhh! I...
 Aaah! Aaahhh!"
#
She holds herself on all fours and begs me to
come over and over.
#
I finally get a break after coming for the fifth
time.
#
<background "ev081a1.iph" 10>
<name "Lynth" "!NB0027">
"..."
#
She fusses over my tired body and licks me on the
cheek.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"..."
#
She runs her tongue from my cheek to my neck and
lovingly nibbles on it.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"If you seriously bit me there, you could kill
 me, you know."
#
<name "Lynth" "!NB0028">
"Ah...ah...mmm..."
#
She looks at me in confusion.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Don't you hate me?"
#
She shakes her head.
#
<name "Lynth" "!NB0029">
"Before... I hated you.
 But now..."
#
She taps the collar on her neck.
#
<name "Lynth" "!NB0030">
"I belong to you."
#
She rubs her cheek on mine.
#
She started acting like this after I put that
collar on her.
#
...
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I'm not with you because I love you.
 I'm just stealing your mana."
#
<name "Lynth" "!NB0033">
"I don't care.
 All of me belongs to you..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Your loyalty is wasted."
#
<name "Lynth" "!NB0034">
"I made up my mind on my own.
 Don't worry about it."
#
She's from a race of beast people.
#
Ferocious to their enemies.
#
But what's right in front of me is something else
entirely.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...Be with me one more time."
#
<name "Lynth" "!NB0037">
"Okay.ÅÙ"

<name "Soshiette" "!DA0978">
"Thank you very much."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...What's she like when I'm not here?"
#
<sprite "ta04a62.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0979">
"Well behaved."
#
As she's stopped resisting, the Guild's been
giving her a little more freedom, but she's still
a prisoner.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...Any signs of resistance?"
#
<sprite "ta04a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0980">
"None.
 I believe the odds she's faking it are low too."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...What's going to happen to her?"
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0981">
"She'll be given some freedom.
 She's being considered for assistance with Guild
 activities."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Assistance?
 Going to use her to take down Krun?"
#
<sprite "ta04a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0982">
"No, just as a regular wizard.
 Demihumans with magical talent are rare, and
 she has more than enough mana for it."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...My request was approved?"
#
<sprite "ta04a62.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0983">
"Yes. The rest is up to her, but if you tell her
 to, I don't anticipate any issues."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"All right.
 I'll explain it to her."
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0984">
"I'm sorry for troubling you."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"My whole life is trouble.
 Besides, she's a princess."
#
<sprite "ta04a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0985">
"I understand."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
A few days later, Princess Lynth was released.
#
She'd be watched for a while, but it's less of
a hassle than managing a prisoner.
#
Soon after, she decided to enter Rune Academy,
by her own will.
#
Publicly, it was announced that she decided to
stay in Queensbell to study magic.
