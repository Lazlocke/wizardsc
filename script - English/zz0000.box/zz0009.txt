"Master, could we have a little sparring match?"

"Yeah, I don't mind.
 Where's the protector?"

"A real fight, please."

"Huh?"

Five minutes later, I was splattered on the
ground.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Urgh...
 After playing through so many times, you've
 definitely gotten stronger."
#
<sprite "ta01a08.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Celes" "!AA7138">
"What are you doing, Master?
 We've only just gotten started."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Huh?"

<sprite "ta01a20.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7139">
"You took my first time by force.
 I thought I was going to die."

"Huh?"

<sprite "ta01a23.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7140">
"And then you treated me like a sex slave...
 I had to endure the humiliation for mana..."

<name "Lazlocke">
"Eep..."
#
<sprite "ta01a22.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7141">
"But the humiliation kept going, until today..."
#
<sprite "ta01a25.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7142">
"Would it be like this if I were the master?
 Give me your ass, you worthless man."

"W-Worthless man is... cruel."

<name "Celes" "!AA7143">
"Heheheh...
 Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
 Come on, already."

"E-Eep!"

"If you can't do it yourself...
 Heheheh..."

I wake up in bed.
#
A-A dream?
#
I check my body.
#
...
#
I'm okay.
#
Thank goodness.
#
It was just a nightmare.
#
<background "bg002a0.iph" 11>

<name "Celes" "!AA7145">
"Good morning, Master.ÅÙ"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Y-Yeah, morning."
#
Celes steps up, gives me a light hug and then
kisses me on the cheek.
#
<sprite "ta01a15.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7146">
"Is something the matter?
 You look pale."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"No, it's nothing."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
She seems the same as usual.
#
Nothing different.
#
...Was it just the dream?
#
But...
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Celes."
#
<sprite "ta01a07.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Celes" "!AA7147">
"Yes?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Let's go shopping today.
 I'll buy you wantever you want."
#
<sprite "ta01a09.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7148">
"Really?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, since you're always working so hard."
#
<sprite "ta01a15.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7149">
"Thank you very much."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"And let's go out to eat."
#
<sprite "ta01a92.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7150">
"So extravagant...
 Do we have enough money?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Don't worry about it.
 In case of emergency, I can borrow from the 
 Guild."
#
<sprite "ta01a15.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7151">
"It's not good to be in debt.
 Oh, that's right, Master."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hm?"
#
<sprite "ta01a17.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7152">
"I just learned a new technique, so could we have
 a little sparring match before we go shopping?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"..."
#
<sprite "ta01a32.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7153">
"Um, Master?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Maybe it's too late, but I promise I'll take
 better care of you."
#
<sprite "ta01a36.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7154">
"Huh?
 Um, the match..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"If you need me to say I'm sorry, I'll get down on
 my hands and knees."
#
<sprite "ta01a27.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7155">
"Um?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"So... Please no sparring."
#
<sprite "ta01a37.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7156">
"Huh?"

<removesprite -1 11>
I bow my head to her on the spot.
#
New Game+ has made her way too strong.
