Every single wizard is foolhardy,
temperamental, eccentric, and just plain
strange.
#
They're twisted, inside and out.
#
There's no redeeming them.
#
I say that as fact.
#
I'm sure of it.
#
Because I'm a wizard too.
#
<music 11>
<background "bg009a0.iph" 11>
<sprite "ta00a00.iph" 4 4 11>
My name is Lazlocke Althorn.
#
I'm a wizard working for the Wizard's Guild.
#
Like it or not, I've been a wizard since I was
a kid. I know enough and am skilled enough to
turn that into fulfilling Guild jobs for
money.
#
Also, Loria, the town where I am, is the
base for the Wizard's Guild.
#
There's no shortage of work.
#
<removesprite -1 11>
But there is a shortage of money.
#
Magic doesn't come cheap.
#
You don't need anything to do the simple 
stuff, but to create new spells, research new
theories, or put them into practice, that you
need money for.
#
You also need money to eat.
#
You could be able to cast the most 
unbelievable spell imaginable, and you still
wouldn't be able to buy a single loaf of bread
without money.
#
Years ago, I combed the Guild's library for
spells to create food, but I couldn't find
anything.
#
I guess nobody ever bothered to spend the 
effort on something that mundane.
#
Actually, it's probably because it's 
impossible.
#
Magic can't do everything.
#
Fire is hot, the sky is vast, rivers flow
downhill.
#
It's just the way things are.
#
Magic can only do so much.
#
But we don't have a good idea what its limits
actually are.
#
It seems to do the impossible.
#
It seems like there's limitless potential in
it.
#
That's fascinating.
#
Wizards are pathetic creatures enraptured by
it.
#
But, well, I can cry about that as much as I
want, and it won't do anything about my 
hunger.
#
What a pain.
#
I should get home and make something to eat.
#
Better get going.
#
<music 2>
<background "bg012a0.iph" 11>
My house is pretty far from the city proper.
#
Normally, it's a carriage ride.
#
But I was worrying about money and chose to
skip the cost.
#
Sigh...
#
It's a brand new year.
This is pathetic.
#
...As I'm walking, a shrill voice catches my
ear.
#
I look over and see a bunch of young women.
#
They're all wearing the same thing. Anybody
living in this town would recognize it, the
uniform of Rune Magic Academy.
#
Certainly quite fetching, but something's up
here.
#
For a second, it looks like a fight, but 
that's not it.
#
There's one girl in the middle that they're
all standing around talking about.
#
And it's not nice.
#
Contempt would be putting it mildly.
#
Sheesh. Now what?
#
Rune Magic Academy...
#
It's one of the schools run by the Guild.
#
They bring in people who have a magical talent
and teach them the basics of wizardry.
#
The Guild trains and equips the next
generation.
#
But it also puts the difference of those who
can use magic and those who can't into stark
relief.
#
Students, especially those who hadn't been
able to use magic before coming here tend to
let it go to their heads.
#
A lot of them look down on people who can't
use magic.
#
That's probably precisely what I'm seeing
right now. I make my way over to deal with it.
#
But before I get there, they apparently lose
interest and start walking off.
#
When I get there, only the girl they had
surrounded is left.
#
She's just standing there.
#
<music 5>
<background "ev001a0.iph" 10>
She's covered in a dingy cloak.
#
Her beautiful long hair looks completely out
of place in it.
#
For a second, I think she might be the daughter
of some noble, but then I notice.
#
Her face is haggard and exhausted.
#
A noble wouldn't be like this.
#
But despite her clear fatigue, her eyes are
bright and strong.
#
Hm...
#
For starters, I nod to her.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I don't know what that was about, but I 
 apologize for them. If you're upset, tell the
 Guild about them. I'm sure they'll provide
 compensation."
#
The Guild mainly trains and cares for wizards,
but it also polices itself.
#
It has no qualms about punishing wizards who
give the rest of us a bad name.
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0001">
"..."
#
She tries to say something, but her voice was
too quiet for me to hear.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hm? What was that?"
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0002">
"Are you... a wizard?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, a poor one though."
#
Technically, I guess I am associated with the
school.
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0003">
"...Please teach me."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Huh? What do you mean?
 Are you lost?"
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0004">
"Please teach me magic."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Magic?"
#
It takes my brain a moment to catch up.
#
She wants me to teach her magic?
#
With Rune Academy right here, I never thought
I'd hear that.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Is this because they were picking on you?
 You shouldn't bother. It's not as great as you
 think it is."
#
She shakes her head.
#
...
#
Seems like her mind's made up.
#
Hm...
#
Well, whatever.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"If you want to learn magic, go to Rune Magic
 Academy. It's the same place those people
 before are from, but they're not all like
 that."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Tuition's expensive, but there are lots of 
 programs for dealing with that. If you're
 qualified, you should be able to learn pretty
 cheaply."
#
Yeah, if you want to be a wizard these days,
your best bet is with Rune.
#
They'll teach you the basics and if you want to
go further, you can join the Guild and research
whatever you want.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"There'll be some qualification checks before
 admitting you, but as long as you can pass
 those, you can become a wizard."
#
Despite saying that, I say a silent apology in
my head.
#
It's just not happening.
#
There's multiple conditions for enrolling in
Rune.
#
Two in particular above all others.
#
First, whether there's mana in your body.
#
Right now, the only way we know to use magic is
to channel the mana inside yourself.
#
In short, without mana, you can't be a wizard.
#
There aren't many people with enough mana to be
able to use magic.
#
Less than one in a hundred, I think.
#
And there's another big hurdle as well.
#
You have to be able to channel mana into your
body.
#
Even if you can use the mana inside you, if you
can't recover it, then you may as well not be
able to use magic at all.
#
Most people can't easily recover their mana 
once it's gone.
#
Put those together, and only maybe one in a
thousand can be a wizard.
#
And then you have to factor in the intensive
training, and only a tiny fraction of the 
population can become wizards.
#
I don't think the girl before me can climb such
a steep mountain.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Studying to become a wizard is brutal.
 I'm not trying to insult you, but you should
 find something else to do."
#
I'm trying to be nice, but her response 
surprises me.
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0005">
"The school... expelled me."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Huh? Expelled you?"
#
What?
#
They kicked her out?
#
As long as she was paying her tuition, I can't
imagine them expelling anybody.
#
Or rather, if you've got the potential to be a
wizard, I can't see them letting you go no
matter the cost.
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0006">
"They said I lack potential."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Huh?"
#
This is getting more confusing.
#
Rune teaches magic.
#
It takes everyone who enters and turns them 
into proper wizards.
#
That's its sole reason for existence.
#
They don't care how much potential you have.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Did you cause some kind of major problem?"
#
I ask, but I've been around here for a few
years now.
#
I haven't heard of anything all that 
interesting happening at Rune.
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0007">
"No..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Then why were you expelled?"
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0008">
"I... don't have mana."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Huh? Didn't they check for that before they
 admitted you?"
#
Rune will let you stay as long as you keep
paying your tuition, but they wouldn't let
someone in who didn't have mana in the first
place.
#
Like I said, you can't use magic at all without
mana.
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0009">
"The school... made a special exception.
 They said I could stay there for a month 
 because there was a chance being somewhere
 with a lot of mana would change my body."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Somewhere with a lot of mana? 
 Well, I guess, maybe."
#
There are very few people with the potential to
become wizards.
#
So for ages, people have been researching ways
to let anybody, even just regular people, learn
how to use magic.
#
One of the ways is to change your body's
chemistry by long-term exposure to an area very
concentrated with mana.
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0010">
"I was allowed there for three months, but...
 it didn't work."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Well, the fastest I've ever heard that working
 took six months, but being affected by mana
 that fast drives you mad, to say nothing of
 what would happen in just a few weeks." 
#
Some have succeeded in the past, but almost
none didn't go crazy.
#
And the level of mana at Rune is nowhere even
close to what it would take.
#
I let out a big sigh.
#
She asked me to teach her magic.
#
But if she doesn't have mana, she can't use
magic.
#
Magic is execution.
#
She could read all the books and learn 
everything, but still not be able to put any of
it into practice.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I'm not sure what your reasons are, but if you
 don't have mana, you can't become a wizard.
 It's like a fish dreaming about becoming a
 bird."
#
<background "ev001a1.iph" 11>
<name "Girl" "!AA0011">
"..."
#
Her eyes well up and she turns away from me.
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0012">
"I'm sorry. 
 I was asking too much."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I'm glad you understand.
 You shouldn't stay here.
 Go on home."
#
She doesn't respond.
#
...
#
<music 2>
<background "bg014a0.iph" 11>
I turn my back on her and head for home.
#
Now then, what should I have for dinner?
#
I still have bread, and I can reheat the soup
I had for lunch...
Ugh, pathetic.
#
Maybe I should buy something nice while I'm
here and treat myself.
#
Market street's right over there.
#
Money, though...
#
That's the problem. 
Maybe I can find something cheap.
#
I'm not sure how fancy a dinner I can make with
cheap food though.
#
...
#
.........
#
I stop.
#
...
#
Her face flickers in my thoughts.
#
She was so tired.
#
I wonder how long she was standing there.
#
It must've been for days.
#
But why?
#
That street's near the Guild's main building.
#
So she was probably there looking for a wizard
passing by.
#
...Despite being mocked by students from the 
school that threw her out.
#
...
#
.........
#
Another big sigh.
#
I turn around and go back.
#
Will she still be there?
#
Of course she will.
#
She must be.
#
There's something driving her.
#
And I was right.
#
<music 5>

"W-Whatever it takes."

"...Will you be my apprentice?"

"Huh?"

"If you become by apprentice, I can provide you
 mana and teach you how to use magic."
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0020">
"R-Really!?"
#
I have the ability to make this mana-less girl
a wizard.
#
I hate that.
#
It's also what makes me who I am.
#
It's a constant reminder of how different I am
from regular people.
#
Using it, I could make her a wizard.
#
But it's up to her what kind of wizard she'll
be.
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0021">
"Please! I'm begging you!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hold on. Don't make a rash decision."
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0022">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I realize you may have been waiting here for a
 long time, but you can't possibly believe
 something so perfect would just fall into your
 lap."
#
<name "Girl" "!AA0023">
"..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"There's a price to pay for being my apprentice.
 Make your decision after I tell you the entire
 story."

"O-Okay."

<name "Lazlocke">
"What's your name?"

"C-Celestine."

"That's a mouthful.
 Will Celes be okay?"

<name "Celes" "!AA0029">
"Yes, that's what my friends call me."

<name "Lazlocke">
"I'm Lazlocke. I can tell you what you need to
 know as we walk. 
 Come along."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0030">
"Yes, sir!"
#
<music 11>
<background "bg020a0.iph" 11>
But she doesn't make it very far.
#
She takes just a few steps, and then...
#
She slumps to the ground, completely wiped out.
#
No doubt from exhaustion and lack of sleep.
#
...
#
This is going to be a pain...
Well, if she didn't have it in her to push 
herself to her limits, she was never going to
be a wizard in the first place.

What is magic?
#
Magic is the process of converting mana into
power.
#
So what is mana?
#
Depending on the time and place, it might be
called divinity, chi, spirit, essence, 
malevolence, or just plain superpower.  
Whatever you call it, it's all the same thing.
#
It's a power that fills the whole world.
#
Countless people live their lives without
knowing anything about mana.
#
As long as it doesn't concentrate too much in
any place, and nothing causes it to go haywire,
it's totally harmless.
#
It's extremely rare for mana to concentrate 
like that, so not many people know or care
about it happening.
#
Magic is how you convert mana into something
useful.
#
Those who use magic are what we call wizards.
#
Mana can be converted to flame, cause objects
to float, and all kinds of other useful
applications.
#
But in order to use magic, mana has to be taken
into your body and captured there.
#
The mana inside you can be made to react with
the mana in the world, and changed into power.
#
That's why the ability to store mana inside you
determines whether or not you can use magic.
#
But the truth of the matter is that everybody
can absorb and store mana inside them.
#
It's everywhere and all around us.
#
Even a completely regular person will naturally
absorb a fair amount over their lives.
#
The issue is the amount.
#
The amount of mana a normal person will absorb
over their entire life isn't even enough to
start a campfire.
#
To use magic, you need to be able to take in far
more mana than a regular person, and you need to
be able to hold onto it.
#
Whether or not you can do it is almost entirely
determined when you're born.
#
That's why they call magic an innate talent.
#
<music 5>
<background "bg002a0.iph" 11>
I carry Celes back to my house and leave her on
a bed.
#
She didn't wake up until the afternoon of the
next day.
#
But she was still too weak to get up.
#
It took her three days, including my magical
treatment, before she was able to move again.
#
A full week passed before she had fully
recovered.
#
<background "ev002a0.iph" 10>

"If you want to be a wizard, you need to take
 better care of yourself."

<name "Celes" "!AA0032">
"I-I'm sorry.
 I'll be more careful."
#
She sits down on the couch in her new clothes.

<name "Lazlocke">
"Now then, let's continue from where you
 passed out."
#
I put a cup of tea down in front of her and
take a seat.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0033">
"Y-Yes, sir."
#
She asked about this from bed, but I told her to
wait.
#
She needed to concentrate on recovering first
and foremost.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I'm sure you're already aware, but this is
 my home. I brought you here when you passed

I live on the outskirts of Loria in the

 There's just one thing."

"You will give yourself to me.
 Do you understand what I mean?"

"Huh?"

She blushes and looks down. 
I ignore her reaction and continue.

"I have regular need of a woman.
 I've made due in various ways so far, but it
 would be a great help if I had a readily

#
<name "Celes" "!AA0038">
"R-Readily?"

"Correct. You would live in my home, stay by my

"I... I have to become a wizard, no matter
 what."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"May I ask why?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0043">
"M-My full name is Celestine Rococo.
 I'm the only daughter of the Rococo family."
#
Rococo?
#
That's a pretty famous family of wizards over
in the Arkanes Kingdom just north of Queensbell.
#
I do remember hearing that the current head of
the family died last year.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"A question of succession then?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0044">
"Yes, but without mana, I can't be a wizard,
 and am prohibited from succeeding my family."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"So you want to become a wizard to inherit your
 family's estate?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0045">
"No. That's not why."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hm?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0046">
"My father was murdered."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"..."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0047">
"And the current head of Rococo is who was
 behind it. I have proof."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Take it to the Guild.
 They'll punish him and drive him out."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0048">
"If I did that, there would be no wizards left
 in the Rococo family and we would lose 
 everything."
#
Now it's getting clearer.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0051">
"But if I become a wizard, and take it back
 from him myself..."
#
I see. A story of revenge...
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"All right. I understand."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0052">
"Then..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yes, I can supply you with mana and teach you
 magic."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0053">
"Thank you so much."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"But time isn't on your side."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0054">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"The current head could protest a duel as
 unjust. The Guild won't recognize your claims
 unless you make them within the next four
 years."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0055">
"R-Really!?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah. I'll check into it as well."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0056">
"T-Thank you."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Now then, no time to waste. 
 Change into something easier to move in and go
 jog in the backyard. You're still recovering,
 so let's say just ten laps."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0057">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Huh, what?
 You want to be a wizard, don't you?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0058">
"Y-Yes, sir.
 But..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"You need a strong constitution to use magic.
 Running will get you in shape.
 Do you have an issue with that?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0059">
"N-No, sir..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"A little more enthusiasm."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0060">
"Y-Yes, sir!
 I'll go run!"
#
<music 2>
<background "bg001a0.iph" 11>
She hurries to her room, changes, and goes out
to the backyard.

"Don't forget to stretch first."
