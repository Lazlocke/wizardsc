"I-I made lunch."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Thank you."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
Celes and I are splitting the housework, but
we don't have assigned jobs.
#
Whoever's not busy has to take care of whatever
needs to be done.
#
Hm...
#
<sprite "ta01a27.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Celes" "!AA0063">
"I-I'm done eating."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Thank you for lunch."
#
<sprite "ta01a29.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0064">
"Master..."
#
She started calling me that after becoming my
apprentice.
#
It was embarrassing at first, but once I got
used to it, I kind of liked it.
#
It's got a nice ring to it.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yes?"
#
<sprite "ta01a32.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0065">
"I-I'm sorry I'm a bad cook!"
#
She apologizes profusely.
#
She's right though.
Nobody would call that tasty.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Well, practice makes perfect."
#
<sprite "ta01a29.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0066">
"I'm sorry..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I'll clean up.
 Take a break, and then get back to your
 exercises."
#
<sprite "ta01a32.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0067">
"Let me clean up on my break."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Don't worry about it. 
 I'm at a block with my work anyway.
 I need a change of pace."
#
<sprite "ta01a27.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0068">
"Thank you."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"If you want to do something while you rest, 
 read that book I gave you."
#
<sprite "ta01a07.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0069">
"All right."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
It's been a few days since we started and she's
been dutifully following my instructions.
#
Well, she messes up stuff like cooking, and
there's been times when she couldn't handle the
regimen I set, but I haven't seen any sign of
her trying to cut corners or slack off.
#
She's always doing her best to do exactly what
I tell her to.
#
An apprentice like her is wasted on me.
#
<music 25>
<background "ev006a0.iph" 10>
After a short break, Celes begins jogging in
the backyard.
#
I have a table set up where I can keep an eye
on her. I lay out some books and sigh.
#
One of the jobs I have from the Guild is to
review various documents.
#
Honestly, it's not hard work, but it is
tedious.
#
Seeing how hard she's working helps me to
buckle down and concentrate.
#
But as soon as I get motivated, an interruption
appears. Out of nowhere, a woman dressed as a
maid is standing in the room with me.
#
<music 26>
<background "bg004a0.iph" 11>
<sprite "ta04a04.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Maid" "!DA0000">
"Quite the hard worker, isn't she?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I don't remember hearing a knock."
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Maid" "!DA0001">
"Pay it no mind."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"..."
#
I want to yell at her that I absolutely should
care about that, but hold my tongue.
#
I've yelled at her before, and she never
listens.
#
Her name's Soshiette.
#
Despite how she's dressed, she's not a maid.
#
She's a full-fledged wizard in the Guild.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"So, what are you here for today?"
#
<sprite "ta04a86.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0002">
"Down to business already?
 I believe it's common courtesy to offer your
 guest a cup of tea."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Make it yourself if you want it.
 What are you here for?"
#
When she sees that I'm not in the mood, 
she relents.
#
<sprite "ta04a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0003">
"I have the report on the Rococo family."
#
She hands me a sealed envelope.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Oh? Thank you."
#
I had asked the Guild to look into what Celes
told me.
#
<removesprite -1 11>
I break the seal and open the envelope.
#
But there's nothing inside.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"What?"
#
I open it wide, but there's nothing there.
#
<sprite "ta04a12.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0004">
"The report is in my head."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"..."
#
Instead of complaining, I throw the pointless
envelope on the floor.
#
<sprite "ta04a11.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0005">
"That is what's elegant."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
I close my eyes and rub my forehead.
#
This is fine.
I'm patient.
#
I can handle this.
At least, I try to convince myself that.
#
She ignores me and continues talking.
#
Eventually she gets to the point.
#
<sprite "ta04a04.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0006">
"According to the report, Celestine is indeed
 the former lord's daughter."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I see."
#
<sprite "ta04a06.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0007">
"There's no seal on her or anything similar?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Right."
#
I did some checks on her while she was
recovering. There's no seals or curses on her
that would be blocking her mana.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Well, just being the child of a wizard doesn't
 mean you'll be one."
#
<sprite "ta04a22.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0008">
"True."
#
And vice-versa, the children of regular people
can become wizards.
#
That's how Soshiette and I are.
#
<sprite "ta04a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0009">
"Next, as for the question of Rococo
 succession, there's only bad news.
 It appears certain that the current lord
 ordered the assassination of the previous one."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Just like she said, huh?
 Then can't she make an accusation and force a
 duel?"
#
<sprite "ta04a24.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0010">
"No, that won't be possible."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Why not?"
#
<sprite "ta04a26.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0011">
"The current lord was brought into the family
 precisely because the previous lord's only
 daughter had no magical talent."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"So he was brought on as an apprentice and
 promised to be given the lordship?"
#
<sprite "ta04a22.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0013">
"Correct."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"And what's the Guild's position?"
#
<sprite "ta04a23.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0014">
"They have decided not to sanction a duel."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"..."
#
The Guild polices wizards, but that doesn't 
mean everyone faces justice.
#
There's often times when it's better for the
Guild itself to stay out of things.
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0015">
"However, the situation would be different if
 the accuser were to show talent."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Meaning what?"
#
<sprite "ta04a11.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0016">
"If the accuser... the previous lord's daughter
 shows sufficient aptitude as a wizard, the
 current lord could be forced out."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I see. How much aptitude would she need to
 show to convince them?"
#
<sprite "ta04a08.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0018">
"Enough to win the Courdures Magic Tournament?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"..."
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0019">
"And it must be within three years."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Huh?"
#
<sprite "ta04a04.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0020">
"The statute of limitations we discussed.
 She had four years.
 There's just over three left."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I want your honest opinion."
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0025">
"Yes?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Do you think there's any chance at all for
 someone who hasn't cast a single spell in 
 their life to win at Courdures in just three
 years?"
#
<sprite "ta04a28.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0026">
"I do not."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...Yeah."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
But it's not like we have a choice.
#
So the only path is forward.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Celes."
#
I call her over from running.
#
<sprite "ta01d07.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Celes" "!AA0070">
"C-Coming!"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
She trots straight over.
#
I tell her what Soshiette told me.
#
<sprite "ta01d06.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Celes" "!AA0072">
"Win the Coudures Magic Tournament..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Within three years.
 If you do that, the Guild will back your
 claim."
#
<sprite "ta01d09.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0073">
"I-I understand.
 I just have to win."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"That's right, but it won't be easy."
#
<sprite "ta01d15.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0074">
"T-That's okay!"
#
She closes her eyes tight and steels herself.
#
<sprite "ta01d20.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0075">
"I can do it!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Good answer."
#
I nod, pleased.
Soshiette steps up beside me.
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta01d20.iph" 2 5 11>
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 6 4 11>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0027">
"You're quite the spirited girl."
#
<sprite "ta01d06.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0076">
"Um, a housekeeper?
 Was my cooking that bad?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Oh, she may be dressed like a maid, but she's
 technically a wizard."
#
<sprite "ta01d08.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0077">
"Eeh!?"
#
<sprite "ta04a04.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0028">
"I'm Soshiette.
 Not Soshietta, not Soshaette."
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0029">
"Soshiette. I hate it when people get my name
 wrong, so please remember it."
#
<sprite "ta01d09.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0078">
"Y-Yes, ma'am."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"She's who brought your new clothes after you
 passed out. I think you owe her a thank you."
#
<sprite "ta01d15.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0079">
"Thank you very much."
#
<sprite "ta04a11.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0032">
"Think nothing of it. 
Å@His Grace begged me for help in his time of
 need. I couldn't miss a chance to indebt him
 to me."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hey. Don't make things up.
 I did no such thing."
#
She just happened to be here from the Guild to
check up on me right after I brought Celes
home.
#
<sprite "ta01d27.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0080">
"Um, his grace?"
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0033">
"It's elegant."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"She calls me that on her own.
 Ignore her."
#
<sprite "ta01d07.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0081">
"O-Okay."
#
<sprite "ta04a04.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0034">
"How well behaved."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Unlike you."
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0035">
"My, my.
 If you'll excuse me, Lady Celestine..."
#
<sprite "ta01d07.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0082">
"Huh? Oh, Celes is fine.
 Please don't call me lady."
#
<sprite "ta04a11.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0036">
"Miss Celes, then. I was watching, and I
 recommend you pay more attention to how you
 move your arms as you run. 
 Your rhythm is often poor."
#
<sprite "ta01d08.iph" 2 5 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0083">
"Huh? Oh, um..."
#
She looks at me, unsure how to respond.
#
Soshiette's likely worth listening to.
#
Although I don't like her usurping my job as
her teacher.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Listen to her. Soshiette is only average as
 a wizard, but in terms of physical and martial
 arts, she's second to none."
#
And even if her actual spellcraft is only about
average, she's far more capable than most
wizards.
#
<sprite "ta04a10.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0037">
"Win the Courdures Magic Tournament.
 It could be nice to be part of that kind of
 miracle."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"She's my apprentice."
#
<sprite "ta04a04.iph" 6 4 12>
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0038">
"I don't intend to take her from you.
 If you'll excuse me for today..."
#
<removesprite 6 11>
She bows and leaves as quickly as she came.
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta01d06.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Celes" "!AA0084">
"Master, can I ask a question?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hm? What is it?"
#
<sprite "ta01d08.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0085">
"Why was Soshiette dressed like a maid?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I've asked that question myself.
 She says it's camouflage."
#
<sprite "ta01d27.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0086">
"Camouflage?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Apparently to hide that she's a wizard."
#
<sprite "ta01d31.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA0087">
"She's unusal, isn't she?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Agreed.
 Back to work, Celes."
#

<name "Celes" "!AA0088">
"Y-Yes, sir!"
