"Okay, this is part two on the properties of mana
 and a wizard's bride."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1365">
"Here, I'd like to talk about Lazlocke's power,
 known as a wizard's bride."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1366">
"I'll continue as if I was a teacher."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1270">
"Question."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1367">
"Yes, Elle?"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1271">
"Why like a teacher?
 I'm okay with how you talk normally..."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1368">
"Normally, I don't discuss this kind of thing
 with anywhere near as much patience."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1272">
"I-I'm sorry.
 Please go ahead."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1369">
"Okay, let's review this together."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1370">
"Now then, a wizard's bride is, put simply,
 somebody with a massively increased ability to
 gather and store mana compared to other people."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1273">
"From a wizard's point of view, it's a very
 enviable thing."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1371">
"A wizard's bride has the following powers."
#
-Take and transfer mana.
-Increase mana capacity.
-Control mana.
-Read mana.
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1372">
"Physical contact is required in all cases.
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1274">
"You mean sex."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1373">
"Actually, it's possible just by touching, even
 hand to hand."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1275">
"Eeh!?
 Seriously!?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1374">
"However, Lazlocke focuses on sexual contact for
 efficiency's sake."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1276">
"How much more efficient is it?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1375">
"About a thousand times."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1277">
"Meaning... You'd have to hold hands for a
 thousand days to get as much mana as one night of
 sex?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1376">
"Correct."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1279">
"Hmmm...
 Sex is definitely the better way then."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1377">
"So let's go over each power in turn.
 First, steal and transfer mana.
 That's easy enough to understand."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1280">
"He can take mana from someone, or give it to
 them."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1378">
"Correct.
 Next is increasing the amount of mana one can
 hold."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1281">
"That's also easy to understand.
 He increased the amount of mana I can possess."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1379">
"That's right.
 Then... controlling mana."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1282">
"I don't understand that well."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1380">
"It means that he's able to amplify mana in his
 recipient to increase their power, or agitate it
 to make them unable to use magic for a time."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1283">
"He can do that?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1381">
"Yes. It takes about three days to be able to
 achieve that effect.
 Disabling someone's magic lasts for about a
 month."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1284">
"Ooh..."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1445">
"However, it's pretty intimate and erotic... ahem.
 Apparently it's quite difficult."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1285">
"It's not so easy, huh?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1383">
"If it was, we would have figured it out a long
 time ago."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1384">
"Now then, the last power is reading mana.
 It's the act of reading the history of mana."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1385">
"He can rob someone of basically all their mana,
 and reconstruct it inside himself.
 By reproducing the mana with how it's been used,
 he can cast the same spells as its owner."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1286">
"So he can know what spells a wizard has used."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1386">
"That's right.
 This is the power that has contributed greatly
 to the Guild's recent expansion of influence."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1287">
"They capture female wizards who go against the
 Guild, and then... read them like a book?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1387">
"Yes. Thanks to that, Guild research always has
 tons to do. I've also benefitted greatly from
 that."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1288">
"You learned something?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1388">
"Yes. There was a group that was doing similar
 research to me, but approaching it in a different
 way. I was able to find out without any real
 effort what wasn't going to work."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1289">
"Still...
 A wizard's bride is an incredible thing."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1389">
"It is. Because it's such a terrifying power,
 that's why it's kept top secret and he's kept
 under close watch by the Guild."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1390">
"Naturally, that means he doesn't get to find his
 own happiness."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1290">
"It's a good thing Celes's master was a man then,
 huh?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1391">
"Yes, but there are problems with that too."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1291">
"What are they?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1392">
"Normally, when a wizard's bride gets pregnant and
 gives birth, their power weakens."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1393">
"However, a man can't get pregnant or give birth."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1293">
"Yeah."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1394">
"So his power will never weaken."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1295">
"Isn't that a good thing?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1395">
"I explained in the lecture about mana, but it's
 bad if mana exceeds a certain concentration.
 It poisons the body and the mind."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1296">
"So he has to keep expelling mana forever?
 Physically, with someone else's help to take the
 mana."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1396">
"That's where we are right now."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1397">
"However, there's a limit to that too."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1297">
"How so?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1398">
"Even if a wizard uses up all the mana inside
 their body, their mana will recover."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1298">
"Right."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1399">
"Why is that?"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1299">
"Well, um..."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1400">
"It's because even if you use all of it up, a tiny
 amount is still inside you.
 You could say that it's a part of you."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1401">
"That bit of mana that's a part of you wants to
 keep the mana inside your body at a consistent
 level, and will start pulling in mana from 
 outside your body."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1300">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1402">
"When you remove mana from a place that had a
 stable amount, mana wants to gather again to
 reach the same amount that there was before."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1301">
"I see."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1403">
"Fortunately, you can get rid of that mana too,
 but the amount of mana that's a part of Lazlocke
 is just too much."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1302">
"Then..."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1404">
"He gathers more mana than he expels."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1303">
"Ah..."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1405">
"He still has a long way to go before he's in real
 trouble, but...
 Right now, a lot of research is being done on how
 to avoid the worst case scenario."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1304">
"I hope they can find a treatment."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1406">
"Indeed. And another problem with it is because 
 he's always absorbing mana around him, the 
 strength and accuracy of nearby magic is 
 dampened."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1305">
"That's not good..."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1407">
"It's only natural. Because he's absorbing nearby
 mana, there's less mana in the air around him."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1408">
"In other words, the mana near him is always
 fairly thin."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1409">
"That's why he lives on the edge of the city, and
 tries to keep his distance from the Guild Tower."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1306">
"O-Oh, I see!"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1410">
"That's the situation that Celes is learning magic
 in. Which is probably why she's made so much
 progress so quickly."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1307">
"O-Oh, I see."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1411">
"In any case, that's the end of our second lecture
 on mana and the power of a wizard's bride."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1412">
"Thank you for sticking through to the end."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1308">
"Thank you very much."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1413">
"Well, see you again, sometime."
