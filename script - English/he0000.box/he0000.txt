 To me, it looks like everyone's off in their

"Setting aside Miss Rune, who has already passed
 out from her liquor, Soshiette is just downing
 glass after glass."
#
<name "Judgeman" "!FA0124">
"Miss Celes, Elle, and Viola all seem like they're
 dancing happily, but none of them are actually
 dancing with each other, or even to the same
 rhythm in the slightest."

"Wizards aren't really a cooperative bunch."
#
<name "Judgeman" "!FA0125">
"You came to the hot springs together, didn't
 you?"

 I'd love to get the recipe for this."

"Thanks. 
 If you want the three up there to get in sync,
 you could try singing."
#

"Indeed!"
#
Judgeman accepts my idea and immediately jumps to
it.
#
Guess he's got a lot on his mind too.
#
Well, it is his job to take care of us.
#
<name "Judgeman" "!FA0128">
"Let's sing a song.

#
I stretch out and relax in my room while the girls
enjoy the hot spring.
#
Apparently this hot spring has mixed bathing, but
I'm definitely not up to stepping into that lion's
den.
#
I mean, it's not that I'm shy about being naked,
or seeing any of them naked.
#
But if I was there, I definitely wouldn't be in
control of anything.
#
I'd definitely end up their plaything.
#
Worst case, I'd be at their complete mercy.
#
I want to enjoy the hot spring.
#
They're trouble that I don't need to deal with.
#
The relaxed air of Aoiya is pleasant enough for
me.
#
Just relax.
#
Yeah, nice and relaxed.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA4839">
"Master!
 The head of the Guild wants you!"

"But the hot spring is right outside your window."

"I propose a preemptive strike against those four.

"Hahaha...

 I've been drinking."
