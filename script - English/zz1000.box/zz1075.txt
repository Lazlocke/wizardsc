Celestine Rococo became a court wizard for the
Queensbell Kingdom.
#
Because of how she did at Coudures, and a
recommendation from the Guild based on her
accomplishments, it's the results of her own hard
work.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6580">
"I never thought I'd become a court wizard."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1020">
"You deserve it.
 Be confident."
#

<name "Elle" "!CA0868">
"That's right.
 From here on, I'll be supporting you and Miss
 Viola."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1021">
"You work for Queensbell, not me."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0869">
"I guess."
#
Elle also became a court wizard.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6581">
"Elle, you visited Krun, right?
 It must have been hard.
 How'd it go?"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0870">
"They were welcoming, and nothing happened really.
 Didn't you have a much harder time?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6582">
"Yes, but Viola was there, so it turned out okay."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0872">
"In the court, call her Miss Viola."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6583">
"I know."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1022">
"I don't need to stand on ceremony."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0873">
"That won't due.
 We have to follow the rules."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6584">
"Yes, ma'am."
#

<name "Viola" "!BA1023">
"So... It's about time for the audience.
 Stand at attention."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6585">
"Yes, ma'am."

I'm proud of what my apprentice has become, and
wonder about taking on another one.
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0875">
"I don't think you need to do that."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6586">
"That's right. 
 Me alone is enough apprentices for you."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Don't you all have work to do?
 Should you be coming to my house?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6587">
"Don't worry about it."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1024">
"We have business with the Guild."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"How does that bring you to my house?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6588">
"This is where we meet."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"..."
#
I think my relationship with these three is going
to last the rest of my life.
