"Master, there are cakes in this world, right?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Cakes have been around since ancient times, but
 not the kinds with frosting or fruit like you're
 imagining."
#
<sprite "ta01a08.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7184">
"Oh? Really?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, but in Wizard's Climber's world, our
 standard cakes have frosting and cream.
 Why!"
#
<sprite "ta01a06.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7185">
"Why?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"It comes to birthdays.
 The image of cakes with frosting are required."
#
<sprite "ta01a15.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7186">
"I see. Cakes and presents are inseparable from
 birthdays!"
#
<sprite "ta01a06.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7187">
"...Speaking of which, in this world, we celebrate
 birthdays."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Of course. The calendar may change, but it's 
 natural to celebrate the birth of a new life."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"But apparently there's not much of a custom to
 celebrate birthdays in the east."
#
<sprite "ta01a10.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7188">
"Eeh? Why not?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"It doesn't matter when you were born.
 You should just be grateful to be alive.
 So they don't bother celebrating personal
 birthdays."
#
<sprite "ta01a08.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7189">
"I see.
 So that's how they think."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Around here, you can kind of divide the way
 people think between the western hunters and
 the eastern farmers."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Anyway, there's no need to whine about how the
 world of Wizard's Climber works!
 There's a lot we've thought about and are just
 choosing to ignore!"
#
<sprite "ta01a09.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Celes" "!AA7190">
"Yeah!
 So even if something isn't historically accurate,
 it doesn't mean we haven't thought about it!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Shh. That's a trade secret."
