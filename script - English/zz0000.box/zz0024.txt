"Here, we'll do an in depth explanation of the
 characteristics of mana and Lazlocke's power." 
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1244">
"It's an honor."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1328">
"First, let's start with mana. Ahem.
 I'm going to use a teacher's tone here."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1245">
"U-Understood."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1329">
"Mana is the general term for the energy that
 exists in living creatures and in the air."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1246">
"Energy?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1330">
"It's fine if you think of it like that."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1331">
"Wizards manipulate the mana inside themselves, 
 and cause it to react with mana in the air, 
 turning it into all kinds of powers."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1332">
"Now then, this mana...
 It has some interesting properties."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1333">
"First, is that it tries to be homogenous."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1247">
"Homogenous?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1334">
"That's right. For example, say you have a big
 box. If you put mana into it, every place in that
 box will have the same density of mana."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1335">
"And no matter how dense the mana is outside of
 the box, it will maintain the same density within
 the box."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1248">
"But Master, don't people sometimes say that mana
 can be thick or thin?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1336">
"There's two reasons for that."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1337">
"First, it can be because something has
 deliberated moved the mana in some way."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1338">
"It happens even with just simple movement.
 Even just the wind blowing moves mana.
 Mana wants to be homogenous, but the world may
 have its own ideas."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1249">
"I see."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1339">
"The other reason has to do with another property
 of mana."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1251">
"What is it?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1340">
"Mana wants to be homogenous, but once it reaches
 a certain concentration, it'll start drawing in
 the mana around it."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1252">
"It pulls it in?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1341">
"That's right. 
 As a result, mana doesn't just diffuse, but
 instead concentrates."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1342">
"But if that was the case, don't you think that 
 mana from all over the world would all come 
 together to a single point?"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1253">
"That's right. Once it starts collecting, wouldn't
 it all gather?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1343">
"That's where the third property of mana comes  
 in."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1254">
"What is it?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1344">
"Once mana reaches a certain concentration, it
 stops pulling mana in, and causes a strange
 phenomenon."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1256">
"Strange?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1345">
"To be honest, nobody really understands it.
 Guild Research is still studying it."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1346">
"We know of cases that including combustion,
 monster summoning, draining the life from every
 living thing in the area.
 None of it is good."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1347">
"Furthermore, we know that high concentrations of
 mana has a deleterious effect on the human mind."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1257">
"S-Scary."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1348">
"However, such high concentrations of mana are
 very difficult to observe in nature."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1349">
"Because while the second property wants to
 concentrate, the strength of the first property
 is proportional to the size of the box."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1258">
"The box?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1350">
"Yes. Remember the box analogy I used earlier?"
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1259">
"I remember."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1351">
"For the second property to kick in, let's say 
 that we need 100 MP."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1260">
"Okay."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1352">
"Now think of the entire world as a big box."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1261">
"I-I'll try."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1353">
"In this entire world-sized box, there's only one
 MP."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1262">
"Huh?
 There's so little?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1354">
"That's right."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1356">
"So high concentrations of mana are something that
 just doesn't ever occur naturally."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1263">
"Oooh."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1357">
"However, for example, leaves can contain mana."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1264">
"Ah, you're right."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1358">
"If you put a lot of mana into a leaf, then you 
 can make the second property of mana trigger,
 which advances to the third property."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1265">
"Ooh...
 But you'd have to put a lot of mana into just
 one leaf, right?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1359">
"I don't know if it was just coincidence or if
 somebody did it on purpose, but there are many
 cases of just that happening."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1360">
"What's more, it's not proven, but there are many
 who believe that the existence of monsters all
 over the world are a result of the third property
 of mana."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1266">
"Hmmm..."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1361">
"By the way, even if you change mana into power,
 as time passes, because it wants to be 
 homogenous, mana will never fully disappear from
 the world."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1267">
"Wizards will be around forever, right?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1362">
"That's right. Well, that's about all you need to
 know about mana.
 Next is Lazlocke's power, the so-called Wizard's
 Bride."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1268">
"I'll study hard."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1363">
"To be continued in part 2 of the properties of
 mana and wizard's bride."
#
...
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Huh? The image had Celes, but only Elle and Viola
 were in this one!"
