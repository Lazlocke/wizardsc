"Master, let me wash your back.ÅÙ"
#
I came to visit Celes at her family home.
#
I was completely awestruck when I saw it.
#
It's so big that it makes Viola's manor look like
a hut.
#
Is this an entire royal villa?
#
It's definitely some kind of huge mansion.
#
The inside was something to behold too.
#
There are dozens of servants just to take care of
all the empty rooms.
#
This place is almost like a small village.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Seriously some kind of noble girl."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6566">
"Who is?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"You, obviously."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6567">
"Not at all."
#
Speaking of which...
#
Even just this bathroom is the size of my entire
house.
#
I knew the Rococo family was rich, but I didn't
realize how rich.
#
She went from living somewhere like this to
training at my house?
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Talk about having it rough."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6568">
"Who?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...Please wash my back."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6570">
"Yes, sir.ÅÙ"
#
<background "ev049a1.iph" 10>
She's planning on working as a wizard while
promoting the Rococo family name.
#
Given the size of this mansion, the latter may
be harder than the former.
#
But I'm sure she can handle it.
#
If she asks for my help, I'll give it to her.
#
As I think about that, I'm going to keep watching
over her.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6571">
"Um, Master."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hm? What is it?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6572">
"You know, I don't have any siblings."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, I know."
#
If she had any other relatives, that other
apprentice couldn't have taken over.
#
She wasn't a wizard, and she was their only
daughter.
#
That's why he targeted her.
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"You've had to work hard by yourself, huh?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6573">
"Yes, but if I don't do something, my bloodline
 will die with me."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"..."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6574">
"So, I had a request..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"A request?"
#
I can't help but notice that she's focused 
somewhere a bit lower than my back.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6575">
"Yes. It should be easy for you."
#
I can't say no to that smile.
