"Here, we'll discuss the history of Celes's
 Master."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"My history?"
#
<sprite "ta02a09.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1311">
"Yes. I thought it was hard to understand in the
 game itself."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I see... But why isn't Celes doing it?
 Or Viola?"
#
<sprite "ta02a03.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1312">
"Consider how many lines they have.
 How much do you think they've already had to 
 talk?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I-I guess.
 Sorry."
#
<sprite "ta02a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1313">
"Okay.
 Let's do our best!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"But shouldn't we have a timeline if we're going
 over my history?
 Images are useful in a lot of ways."
#
<sprite "ta02a03.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1315">
"If you want an explanation for that, it's
 complicated. We're not getting anywhere.
 Please stop interrupting."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"A-All right."
#
<sprite "ta02a09.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1316">
"Now, then...
 Your childhood!"

<sprite "ta03a01.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Viola" "!BA1414">
"I heard he was a boy living in the city..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I was with a group of people who didn't have any
 living relatives."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta02a07.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Elle" "!CA1317">
"A band of thieves?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"No, we did real work, but there are a lot of  
 adults who exploit children.
 Forming a group was to protect ourselves."
#
<sprite "ta02a09.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1318">
"I see...
 And that's what you were doing when you met the
 Guild president."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"The city I lived in was involved in a war.
 She showed up as one of the invaders."
#
<sprite "ta02a06.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1319">
"She was an enemy?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah. That was the first time I met a wizard.
 And she was the strongest of them all."
#
<sprite "ta02a09.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1320">
"You looked up to her?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Mmhmm.
 She was waaaay younger back thgwagh!"
#
<sprite "ta02a32.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1321">
"Huh? What was that?
 Where'd that stone come from?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta03a36.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Viola" "!BA1416">
"...Far away.
 No surprise."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"S-She was much younger then, but her strength
 and beauty were already incredible..."
#
<sprite "ta03a15.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Viola" "!BA1417">
"Grr..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta02a37.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Elle" "!CA1323">
"Oh, Master.
 We're already getting derailed.
 If you use attack magic..."
#
<sprite "ta02a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1324">
"Ahem!
 And apparently then you were asked by her to be
 her apprentice. Did you do something that made
 her see your worth?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"No. Not at all."
#
<sprite "ta02a06.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1325">
"Then why'd she take you as an apprentice?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"She said she wanted to believe I had mana...
 But she was laughing as I looked her in the 
 eyes."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta03a36.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Viola" "!BA1418">
"By the way, for me, she grabbed me by the 
 shoulder and demanded it."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta02a34.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Elle" "!CA1326">
"Hahaha... W-What a forceful woman.
 After becoming her apprentice, you became a
 wizard."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Mmhmm, but even though I had mana, I wasn't
 doing well. She also noticed that the mana around
 me acted strangely."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"And at almost the same time, she..."
#
<sprite "ta02a04.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1327">
"You attacked her!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...No comment."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta03a15.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Viola" "!BA1419">
"I'll fill in then.
 You definitely attacked her."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"You weren't even an apprentice at that point."
#
<sprite "ta03a19.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Viola" "!BA1420">
"I say that knowing exactly who you are.
 You definitely attacked her."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Awww..."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta02a00.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Elle" "!CA1329">
"Well, leaving aside whether or not it's true...
 It turned out that you were a super rare male
 wizard's bride."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah."
#
<sprite "ta02a10.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1330">
"By the way, when I say rare, I mean the first 
 ever male wizard's bride recorded in all of
 history."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"They say a female wizard's bride appears about
 once every ten years."
#
<sprite "ta02a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1331">
"After that, while training me in magic, the two
 of you began studying the power of a wizard's
 bride together."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"As that went on, my sister apprentices started
 gathering."
#
<sprite "ta02a04.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1332">
"The birth of the Great Six."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah. A bunch of weirdos.
 It took a while, but in the end, that's how I
 met Viola."
#
<sprite "ta02a00.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1334">
"What was your first impression of her?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"A quiet bookworm."
#
<sprite "ta02a04.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1335">
"And what was your impression of him?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta03a00.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Viola" "!BA1421">
"Nothing really...
 I wasn't his apprentice, so I didn't pay much
 attention to him.
 Well, he was just like a senior to me."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta02a00.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Elle" "!CA1336">
"I see..."
#
<sprite "ta02a04.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1337">
"And with all that talent, the revival of the
 Wizard's Guild began in earnest."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"No, the revival of the Guild started a little
 bit before that."
#
<sprite "ta02a06.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1338">
"It did?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"My master was already putting a lot of work into
 reviving the Guild even before she took me as an
 apprentice."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta03a00.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Viola" "!BA1422">
"His power certainly accelerated it though." 
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Particularly in research."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta03a00.iph" 2 4 11>
<sprite "ta02a27.iph" 6 5 11>
<name "Elle" "!CA1339">
"The dark side of the Wizard's Guild."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Precisely."
#
<sprite "ta03a16.iph" 2 4 12>
<name "Viola" "!BA1423">
"Which is why what we're talking about is strictly
 top secret. Seriously. Don't talk about it or the
 Guild will send assassins after you."
#
<sprite "ta02a09.iph" 6 5 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1340">
"Y-Yes, ma'am.
 Um... For a while, you kept working for the Guild
 and as a teach at the magic school."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Yeah, and by the way, my work for the Guild 
 wasn't just sex. I did a lot of diplomacy,
 research, and other stuff."
#
<sprite "ta03a01.iph" 2 4 12>
<name "Viola" "!BA1424">
"He was respectable enough."
#
<sprite "ta02a00.iph" 6 5 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1341">
"Totally different from now.
 And then the war broke out between Queensbell and
 Bazur."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<background "ev065a0.iph" 10>
<name "Lazlocke">
"Bazur was out to capture or wipe out the Guild's
 influence, so the Guild allied with Queensbell."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1342">
"It was a great success story for my master."
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1425">
"I-I suppose."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA1343">
"Um, what are you blushing for?"
#
<name "Viola" "!BA1426">
"Don't worry about it."
#
<background "bg002a0.iph" 11>
<sprite "ta02a04.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Elle" "!CA1344">
"After that, he fled."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta03a34.iph" 2 4 11>
<sprite "ta02a04.iph" 6 5 11>
<name "Viola" "!BA1427">
"Because he was so important, the Guild was in a
 panic."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I had a lot on my mind."
#
<sprite "ta02a00.iph" 6 5 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1345">
"A year later, he was found by Soshiette and
 brought back to the Guild president."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Battered and bruised."
#
<sprite "ta02a06.iph" 6 5 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1346">
"After returning to the Guild, he moved to the
 outskirts of Loria and lived an uneventful life
 for the next three years."
#
<sprite "ta03a00.iph" 2 4 12>
<name "Viola" "!BA1428">
"Retirement."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Hahaha..."
#
<sprite "ta02a00.iph" 6 5 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1347">
"And that's when he had the fateful encounter
 with Celes."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Well, I don't know if I'd call it fateful.
 Although it certainly did kick a lot of things
 off."
#
<sprite "ta03a01.iph" 2 4 12>
<name "Viola" "!BA1429">
"Indeed."
#
<sprite "ta02a09.iph" 6 5 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1349">
"I see.
 Thank you very much for listening to the entire
 history of Celes's master, the great Lazlocke."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"No, no."

<removesprite 2 11>
<removesprite -1 11>

"One more question before we end things."
#
<sprite "ta02a04.iph" 4 4 12>
<name "Elle" "!CA1351">
"In the four years between having sex with my
 master and meeting Celes, did you make any
 progress with her in all that time?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"No, none at all.
 Although I do think we've developed a good
 friendship."
#
<removesprite -1 11>
<sprite "ta03a35.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Viola" "!BA1430">
"I-I suppose.
 I... um, am not totally satisfied with certain
  things though."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Huh?"
#
<removesprite -1 11>
We look at each other.
#
<sprite "ta02a09.iph" 4 4 11>
<name "Elle" "!CA1352">
"That's it!
 All done!"
