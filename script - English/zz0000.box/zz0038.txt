"Lately, Lazlocke hasn't been with me at all."

"Seriously..."
#
<name "Tris" "!KB0011">
"Do want him to attack you here?"
#
<name "Mel" "!MB0017">
"Ahaha...
 No way."
#
<name "Marcia" "!JB0018">
"Seriously."
#
<name "Tris" "!KB0012">
"Then what should we do?"
#
<name "Mel" "!MB0018">
"I filed a petition..."
#
<name "Marcia" "!JB0020">
"W-When!?
 I never heard about it!"
#
<name "Tris" "!KB0013">
"We agreed no cutting in line!"
#
<name "Mel" "!MB0019">
"D-Don't worry.
 I put your names on it too."
#
<name "Marcia" "!JB0021">
"Our friendship is eternal."
#
<name "Mel" "!MB0020">
"Yeah.
 I can't believe we have a relationship like this
 though..."
#
<name "Tris" "!KB0014">
"We were rivals in school."
#
<name "Marcia" "!JB0023">
"Hahaha..."
#
<name "Mel" "!MB0024">
"Anyway, if the petition doesn't work, let's talk
 to him directly."
#
<name "Tris" "!KB0015">
"Okay!"
#
There are a lot of groups like that in the Guild.
#
I wonder how long my strength will hold out.
#
<name "Mel" "!MB0022">
"I thought of a spell that enhances endurance and
 stamina."
#
<name "Marcia" "!JB0025">
"I have a spell that increases sensitivity."
#
<name "Tris" "!KB0016">
"I have a spell that turns your mind into a  
 beast."
#
...
#
Seriously, how much longer can I survive this?
