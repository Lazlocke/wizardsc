At a crossroad, a young man runs into a girl.
#
<background "ev110a1.iph" 11>
<name "Girl" "!PC0001">
"Hey!
 Watch where you're going!"
#
She shouts angrily.
#
She's even madder because she dropped the bread
she was carrrying in her mouth.
#
But her shouts don't phase the young man in the
slightest.
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0000">
"Hmm...
 This was not in today's schedule."
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0000">
"It is an unexpected encounter."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0001">
"Ooh, is it?"
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0002">
"Hey! Not even going to apologize for running 
 into me?"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0002">
"Ooh, a feisty one."
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0001">
"Yes, feisty."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0003">
"What are you talking about!?
 Help me up!"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0003">
"Jeeves, the preparations..."
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0002">
"They're already underway.
 Youth is as it always is..."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0004">
"I am once again in your debt.
 Then... ahem."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0005">
"I am the next master of the Goyakusoku family,
 Goyakusoku Mamoru.
 The pleasure is mine."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0004">
"Help me up before you introduce yourself.
 A girl is on the ground."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0006">
"Hmm..."
#
He holds out his hand.
#
She takes it and stands up.
#
But once she's up, he doesn't let go.
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0005">
"What are you doing?
 Let go of me already."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0007">
"I'm sorry, but I can't do that."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0006">
"Huh?"
#
He skillfully knocks her our and carries her into
the nearby parked car.
#
<music 8>
<background "ev111a0.iph" 10>
<name "Girl" "!PC0007">
"W-What the hell?
 What do you think you're doing with me like
 this!?"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0008">
"What do you think?"
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0008">
"...Y-You're going to violate me?"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0009">
"Is there anything else someone would do like
 that?"
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0009">
"C-Come any close and I'll kill you!"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0010">
"I like that feistiness."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0010">
"I-If I go missing, my dad and mom will come
 after you!"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0012">
"That won't be a problem.
 I've already spoken with your parents."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0011">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0013">
"Your father is the president of his company,
 correct?"
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0012">
"T-That's right.
 So if you do something to me..."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0014">
"Do you know the name of the company that owns
 his company?"
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0013">
"Huh?
 N-No way..."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0015">
"Oh, it's not my company."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0014">
"Then so what?"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0016">
"The company that owns your father's company is
 my family's company."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0015">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0017">
"I asked them if their daughter would be my wife,
 and they accepted happily."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0016">
"Huh?
 Your wife?
 What?"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0018">
"It is by our family's tradition.
 If you meet a girl by happenstance on the road,
 you must marry her."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0017">
"What the hell kind of insane tradition is that?"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0019">
"It is what they call a star-crossed meeting.
 It's named for our family's traditions."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0018">
"That cannot possibly be true."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0020">
"Well, it's normal for a husband and wife to meet
 like that, so i see no problem with it."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0019">
"T-There's nothing normal about that.
 And then tieing them up like this?
 Where even are we?
 Your basement?"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0022">
"The wedding night in my family has been like
 this for generations."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0020">
"Then you've been insane for generations!"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0023">
"If you'd like, I can arrange for a photographer
 or recording."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0021">
"Like hell!"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0024">
"Thank goodness.
 I'm not an exhibitionist myself."
#
He plays with her breasts.
#
<background "ev111a1.iph" 10>
<name "Girl" "!PC0022">
"Eep!"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0025">
"Nice feel."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0023">
"Ah! H-Hey! Don't mess with...
 Ah!"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0026">
"Well, as long as you bear me an heir, the life
 of luxury awaits you."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0025">
"An heir?
 Huh? Ah..."
#
He presses his finger against her entrance.
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0026">
"Eek! Ngh... ah...agh...
 Ah!"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0027">
"Tight, huh?
 You'll need to be loosened..."
#
He claps his hand and Jeeves appears with devices.
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0003">
"Which would you like?"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0028">
"Jeeves, your choices are too esoteric.
 A softer touch is preferred."
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0004">
"Then this is most orthodox."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0029">
"Mmhmm."
#
Mamoru takes a few vibrators and attaches them
to the girl's nipples and clitoris.
#
<background "ev111a2.iph" 10>
<name "Girl" "!PC0027">
"W-What are those?"
#
Then he flips the switch of the vibrators attached
to her chest.
#
<background "ev111a3.iph" 10>
<name "Girl" "!PC0028">
"Ah! Ah! Ah! Aah! Ah! Ahhh!"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0030">
"That's a nice voice."
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0005">
"Indeed."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0029">
"S-Stop! Ah! Aah! Ahhhhh..."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0031">
"I'd like to hear it a little longer."
#
He turns on the vibrator attached to her clitoris.
#
<background "ev111a4.iph" 10>
<name "Girl" "!PC0030">
"Ah! Ah! No! No!
 Ah! Ah! Ahhh!"
#
And turns it up even higher.
#
<background "ev111a5.iph" 10>
<name "Girl" "!PC0031">
"Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!"
#
After a short time, a small flood gushes out from
her.
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0032">
"Ah... S-Stop...
 Ah...ahhhhh..."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0032">
"All right. That should have loosened you some.
 So, it's about time..."
#
He takes his erect penis out of his pants.
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0006">
"As splendid as ever, young master."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0033">
"Don't praise me.
 It's embarrassing.
 Now then..."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0033">
"Ah...ah...ah...
 No way...
 D-Don't..."
#
He ignores her and slowly pushes his penis inside
her.
#
<background "ev111a6.iph" 10>
<name "Girl" "!PC0034">
"Ah...aaaah...
 Y-You can't...
 It won't fit..."
#
Her forcibly stretches her open and makes her
accept him.
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0035">
"Aaaahhh!"
#
And in a moment, is buried inside her.
#
<background "ev111a7.iph" 10>
<name "Girl" "!PC0036">
"Nnngh!"
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0035">
"Ooh, tight.
 Very tight.
 Hahahaha... 
 Mm, chance encounters truly are great."
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0007">
"Yes, young master."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0036">
"So let's finish this... quickly."
#
He intensely moves his hips and rubs himself
inside her pussy.
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0037">
"Agh! Agh! Aah! Ah!
 Ah! Aah!"
#
She groans in pain and tries to endure his
movements.
#
She wonders if the torment is ever going to end
when a reprieve suddenly comes.
#
He buries himself deep inside her and hugs her
against him.
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0038">
"Ah...ah..."
#
She realizes what's happening by the sensation
in her pussy.
#
She feels his penis throbbing and his semen 
pouring into her womb.
#
<background "ev111a8.iph" 10>
<name "Girl" "!PC0039">
"Ah...ah...ah...
 N-Noooooooo!!!"
#
Her scream echoes in the basement, but it 
continues for hours.
#
<background "bg024a0.iph" 10>
<background "ev111a9.iph" 10>
<name "Girl" "!PC0040">
"Aah...ah..."
#
She doesn't know how much time has passed.
#
She doesn't know how many times it happens.
All she knows is that he raped her over and over.
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0041">
"Ah...aah..."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0037">
"Heheh...
 I hope you bear a child soon."
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0008">
"Indeed. 
 If you have a successor, then there will be no
 question that you are the head of the Goyakusoku
 family."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0038">
"Mm. I'm looking forward to it.
 Now then, about time, isn't it?"
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0009">
"Yes. Good luck, young master."
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0039">
"Mmhmm."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0043">
"Huh?"
#
Jeeves bows and leaves the basement.
#
The lock on the door clicks shut.
#
It can't be opened from the inside.
#
The girl knows that from what they've said and
done so far.
#
And the only key went out with Jeeves.
Mamoru doesn't have one.
#
What's happening?
#
As she wonders, Mamoru answers.
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0040">
"It is our family tradition.
 After sex with the wife in the basement, the 
 house is burned down."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0044">
"Huh?"
#
There is no deception in his words.
#
<music 40>
<background "ev111aa.iph" 10>
Smoke and flames begin to fill the basement.
#
<name "Mamoru" "!UB0041">
"Come, let us do our best to survive.
 Escaping a burning hall is the greatest trial to
 affirm the love between two people."
#
<background "ev111ab.iph" 10>
<name "Girl" "!PC0045">
"A-Are you shitting me, you idiot!?"
#
The building is consumed in flames.
#
<music 5>
<background "bg024a0.iph" 10>
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0010">
"...Well done."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0046">
"Hmph."
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0011">
"The young master?"
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0047">
"Going down with his house, obviously."
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0012">
"...Oh, I see.
 Then you, his wife, is the new head of the
 family."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0053">
"...I'm the new head of the family?"
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0014">
"Yes."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0049">
"...I see.
 After what happened, I'll take that.
 There's money, right?"
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0015">
"The Goyakusoku family is worth approximately
 172 billion."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0050">
"I-I can't even imagine that much..."
 W-Well, seems like about the right price for my
 virginity."
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0016">
"Now then, new master, first of all, could you
 please read this?"
#
He takes out a large scroll from his pocket.
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0051">
"What's that?"
#
<name "Jeeves" "!SD0017">
"The traditions of the Goyakusoku family."
#
<name "Girl" "!PC0052">
"Oh, I see.
 I'm filthy rich thanks to these traditions.
 I better take good care of them."
#
She laughs as she throws the scroll into the
burning building.

 I wonder what happens next..."

"After that, it becomes a struggle between the
 guy who survived and the Shadow Seven."

"Oh, he survived?"

 You're in the way of cleaning."

"Sorry.
 I'll get back to helping."

<removesprite -1 11>
I put the book away and get back to work.
