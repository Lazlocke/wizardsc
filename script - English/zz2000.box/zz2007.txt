<name "Elle" "!CA0797">
"Aah...ah...ahhh..."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA5671">
"Master, no fair just focusing on her."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"All right."
#
When I try to pull out of her, Elle wraps her
legs around me and stops me.
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0798">
"I-I'm not done yet..."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA5672">
"Elle!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Mmm... Celes, don't be mad."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA5673">
"But!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"You're her big sister when it comes to sex,
 right?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA5674">
"Grrr..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"And... that goes for the size of your chests
 too, right?"
#
As I say that, Elle's pussy squeezes down hard.
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0799">
"I'm not sure I heard you right."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA5675">
"Now, now, Elle."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0801">
"Your huge smile is pissing me off."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I just said it was bigger, I didn't necessarily
 say it was better."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"I don't have a problem with either of your
 sizes."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0802">
"And if you had to pick, which one?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA5676">
"Which?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Mmmmm..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"As a man...
 I feel like this isn't a question you should
 ask during sex."
#
I say that and try to pull out to put a pause
on activities.
#
But both of them stop me.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA5677">
"Master, no fair."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0804">
"No running away."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Um, well..."
#
I spend the whole night attacked by both of
them.
#
Women are fearsome when they work in concert.
