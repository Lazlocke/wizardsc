 Celes is waiting.
 Let's hurry home."

"Here, I cooked this."

<name "Lazlocke">
"Using manipulation magic?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6517">
"Yes, I tried really hard."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"That's a good thing, but it's a risky way to
 train."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6518">
"I'm sorry.
 Can you call Elle?"

<name "Lazlocke">
"All right."

Celestine Rococo and Elle Bluetact.
#
They're both still training.
#
When Viola's busy, I look after Elle.
#
Lately, I've been spending more time taking care
of her than Viola has.

"Grr. I should be your only apprentice."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0865">
"No hogging him."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6520">
"Grrr..."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0866">
"And I should mention, it's just the two of us
 tonight."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6521">
"No fair!
 Today's my turn!"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"If you have energy to fight, use it to train.
 Your grades are still terrible."
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6522">
"I'm sorry."
#
<name "Elle" "!CA0867">
"I'll try my best."
#
Apparently my relationship with them won't be
ending any time soon.
