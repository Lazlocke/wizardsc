"Don't be scared! Forward!
 If we get through this, there's treasure!"
#
Her companions draw strength from her shout and
stab at the huge monster.
#
She backs them up with magic.
They overwhelm it and blast it until it's
smoldering.
#
And then, Celes's magic delivers the finishing
blow.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6592">
"All right!
 Treasure!"
#
But before she can celebrate, three more giant
monsters appear.
#
And an even larger one behind them.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6593">
"You won't let me have the treasure so easily,
 huh?"
#
Her companions shirk in fear, but Celes stands
before them and faces the monsters.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6594">
"But this is how it has to be."
#
<background "ev051a1.iph" 10>
She faces the monsters and attacks.

Celes became an adventurer.
#
Maybe it's because she did so much adventurer
stuff while she was training to be a wizard.
#
Well, she's enjoying herself, so there's nothing
wrong with that.
#
Sitting at a desk isn't the only path to being
a wizard.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6595">
"Which dungeon should we do next?"
#
Still, well...
#
She's become kind of an outdoor wizard.
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6596">
"Master, there's a dungeon I want to go to.
 Can't you come with me?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"...Are the only places you're going to invite
 me dangerous?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA6597">
"Yep."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Don't answer like that with a big smile."
#
Adventurers only go to uncivilized, unknown, and
dangerous places, especially those full of 
monsters and life-threatening hazards.
She'll be an adventurer until she's old and grey.
