"Oh, hello.
 Another fine day."
#
<name "Henrietta" "!HA0325">
"It is.
 It's nice when the laundry dries so fast."
#
<name "Young Thief" "!SB0469">
"Is that woman really her?"
#
<name "Veteran Thief" "!TB0434">
"Yeah.
 Henrietta of Hell.
 Henrietta of the Underworld.
 Henrietta the Killer."
#
<name "Veteran Thief" "!TB0435">
"No matter what horrible name she goes by, she's
 a wizard on part with Viola Entra.
 A devil wearing the skin of a wizard!"
#
<name "Veteran Thief" "!TB0450">
"And nicknamed, The Tyrant!"
#
<name "Young Thief" "!SB0470">
"Gulp."
#
<name "Veteran Thief" "!TB0437">
"But I've heard she's gotten rusty after getting
 married."
#
<name "Veteran Thief" "!TB0438">
"So she's not as strong as she used to be!"
#
<name "Young Thief" "!SB0471">
"I-I see."
#
<name "Veteran Thief" "!TB0451">
"But there still huge fame for going after her!"
#
<name "Young Thief" "!SB0472">
"Yeah!"
#
<name "Veteran Thief" "!TB0440">
"But don't be careless."
#
<name "Young Thief" "!SB0473">
"Y-You say that, but..."
#
<name "Veteran Thief" "!TB0441">
"Even if she's rusty, she's still a devil.
 If you go straight at her, you probably don't
 stand a chance."
#
<name "Young Thief" "!SB0474">
"So..."
#
<name "Veteran Thief" "!TB0442">
"Set up a surprise attack.
 It's sleep when that devil is at her most
 vulnerable!"

"Yeah!"
#
<name "Veteran Thief" "!TB0443">
"We can do it!"
#
<name "Young Thief" "!SB0476">

"Huh?"
#
<name "Henrietta" "!HA0328">
"I've been waiting...
 I knew someone like you would come after me."
#
<name "Henrietta" "!HA0329">
"Being a housewife is so much more stressful than
 I thought it would be."
#
<name "Henrietta" "!HA0330">
"I was just thinking... sometimes, you just need
 a way to blow it all off.
 Heheheh...
 I can't wait until tonight." 
#
<name "Veteran Thief" "!TB0448">
"Eek!

#
<name "Henrietta" "!HA0331">
