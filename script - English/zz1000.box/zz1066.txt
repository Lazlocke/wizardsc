"I'm sorry.
 Master, can you please step back a little
 further?"
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"Huh?"
#
<name "Celes" "!AA0728">
"Um, your power is affecting our mana..."
#
<name "Lazlocke">
"O-Oh, sorry."
#
The two of them are engrossed in a game of king
of the hill.
#
Of course, not a normal game, but one using 
their mana.
#
I'm terrible at it.
#
My power makes me extremely bad at precise
control.
#
So I'm a little jealous of them.

"Your Grace."

<name "Lazlocke">
"Hm?"
#
<name "Soshiette" "!DA0236">
"Comrade!"
#
Soshiette and I play king of the hill away from
them.
#
We both knock over the mountain on the first
turn, so we switch to playing it normally and
still have a lot of fun.
