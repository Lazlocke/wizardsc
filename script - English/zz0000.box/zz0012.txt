I am a tentacle.
#
A long, wriggly, slimy tentacle.
#
Mostly what I do is grab.
#
My hobby is slipping into women's bodies.
#
No men allowed.
#
I'm that kind of tentacle.
#
My name is Johnny.
#
I'm a little different from other tentacles.
#
Please remember that.
#
So let's introduce them.
#
My comrades.
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0484">
"I-I'm proud of my girth!
 I'm Mike!"
#
<name "Anthony" "!RB0439">
"Anthony here, with the delicate movements."
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0414">
"I can suck and bite.
 I'm Jim."
#
<name "Hopkins" "!UA0477">
"Leave the gyrating to me.
 I'm Hopkins."
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0442">
"We five..."
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0500">
"The deadly pervert tentacles!"
#
Our purpose is unknown.
#
But we instinctively attack women.
#
There was a time when I wondered if what we did
was okay.
#
But desire always wins in the end.
#
Laugh at this weak tentacle.
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0486">
"Don't laugh, Johnny."
#
<name "Anthony" "!RB0440">
"Yeah, that's right.
 Without you, we'd just be tentacles."
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0443">
"You guys..."
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0417">
"Johnny!
 A woman!
 Catch her!"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0444">
"Okay, let's go!"
#
<name "Hopkins" "!UA0478">
"Aah! Johnny!
 It's dangerous to appear on the road!"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0445">
"Gaaaaaaaahhh!"
#
<name "Hopkins" "!UA0479">
"Ah, he was run over by a wagon..."
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0418">
"Broooooo!"
#
<name "Anthony" "!RB0441">
"Nothing to do about it now.
 So, I'm the new leader."
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0487">
"Eeh!? 
 Already!?
 Let's grieve a little."
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0419">
"I mean, didn't you just say that without him we
 were just regular tentacles?"
#
<name "Anthony" "!RB0442">
"That was just to cheer him up."
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0420">
"Ooh! What shamelessness.
 Just what I'd expect of our leader!"
#
<name "Hopkins" "!UA0480">
"Long live the new king!"
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0488">
"Hooray!"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0446">
"Hey, jerks."
#
<name "Hopkins" "!UA0481">
"Aah! Johnny!"
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0421">
"H-How!?"
#
<name "Anthony" "!RB0443">
"I always believed you survived!"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0447">
"For now, Anthony, you get to specialize in men."
#
<name "Anthony" "!RB0444">
"N-No way! Noooooo!
 I hate men!"
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0422">
"Still, bro, you survived?"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0448">
"Hmph. Fool.
 We certainly are weak.
 Weak enough to be killed by a carriage running
 over us."
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0449">
"But we have powerful regeneration capabilities!"
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0423">
"O-Oh, we do?"
#
<name "Hopkins" "!UA0482">
"I didn't know."
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0450">
"Man, I've explained this 500 times..."
#
<name "Hopkins" "!UA0483">
"Huh? You have?"
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0489">
"Have you?"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0451">
"It happens every time I die.
 Also, Anthony's betrayed me 500 times."
#
<name "Mike" "!QB0490">
"I don't remember any of it..."
#
Hmmm...
#
I really am not quite like other tentacles.
#
I can think, and observe the tentacles around me.
#
I'm the chosen tentacle.
#
The tentacle of tentacles!
#
<name "Jim" "!TB0424">
"Anyway, bro, the prey's getting away!"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0452">
"All right!
 Let's go!"
#
<name "Hopkins" "!UA0484">
"B-Bro!
 Don't go out on the road!"
#
<name "Johnny" "!SB0453">
"Gaaaaaaaaah!!!"
#
I am one tentacle of many.
#
The king tentacle, Johnny.
#
My story is not yet over.
